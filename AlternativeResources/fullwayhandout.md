9. Finitely repeated games

    We 'repeat' a normal form game $T$ times. Strategies need to be defined to take in to account the entire history of the game.

    What did we do?

    - We played an iterated prisoner's dilemma tournament.

    What do I need to be able to do?

    - Define a repeated game.
    - State and prove the theorem of a sequence of stage Nash profiles.
    - Draw possibly utility outcomes.
    - Obtain subgame perfect Nash equilibria **that are not** a sequence of state Nash equilibria.


10. Infinitely repeated games

    We now 'repeat' a normal form game an infinite amount of times. To deal with this we use discounting.

    What did we do?

    - We played an infinite iterated prisoner's dilemma tournament by introducing a probability of the game carrying on.

    What do I need to be able to do?

    - Calculate expected utilities with discounting.
    - Prove particular instances where a given strategy is better than another.
    - Prove the Folk theorem.


11. Population Games and Evolutionary stable strategies

    We move on to something different and consider populations and how a particular strategy evolves in a population.

    What did we do?

    - We played a brief game with cards in class.

    What do I need to be able to do?

    - Define a population game.
    - State and prove the theorem for necessity of stability.
    - Define a post entry population $\chi_{\epsilon}$ and an ESS.
    - Obtain ESS in a game against the field.


12. Nash equilibrium and Evolutionary stable strategies

    We consider a particular type of game against the field: member of the population are randomly matched and play a normal form game.

    What did we do?

    - Nothing really.

    What do I need to be able to do?

    - Define a pairwise contest game.
    - Find ESS in a pairwise contest game from first principles.
    - State prove and use the theorem relating an ESS to a Nash equilibrium of a normal form game.


13. Random events and incomplete information

    Here we look at extensive form games **with** random events.

    What did we do?

    - 3 volunteers played a version of matching pennies with some randomness involved (someone won a melon)


    What do I need to be able to do?

    - Obtain the normal form representation of a game with incomplete information.
    - Describe basic utility theory.
    - Solve the principal agent game.

14. Stochastic games

    Games where strategies not only define the utilities but the next game.

    What did we do?

    - We played a modified version of the Prisoner's dilemma in the form of a stochastic game (this was a 4 team round robin tournament)


    What do I need to be able to do?

    - Define a stochastic/Markov game, a Markov strategy.
    - State the requirement for Nash equilibrium.
    - Obtain Nash equilibrium for stochastic games.

15. Matching games

    We look at the stable marriage problem and the Gale Shapley algorithm.


    What did we do?

    - We matched 3 volunteers to 3 of my toys (Donatello, Zoe and my Tech Deck).

    What do I need to be able to do?

    - Define a matching game.
    - State and apply the Gale-Shapley algorithm.
    - State and prove the theorem guaranteeing a unique matching as output of the Gale Shapley algorithm.
    - State and  prove the theorem of reviewer sub optimality.


16. Cooperative games

    Sharing resources when considering contribution of coalitions.


    What did we do?

    - We played basketball (kind of).


    What do I need to be able to do?


    - Define a characteristic value game.
    - Define monotone and superadditive games.
    - Define Efficiency, Null player, Symmetry and Additivity (see exercises - you could be asked to prove that the Shapley value has these properties).
    - Define and be able to calculate the Shapley value.


17. Routing games

    Games that can be used to model behaviour in system affected by congestion.


    What did we do?

    - Nothing fun at all...


    What do I need to be able to do?

    - Define a routing game, set of paths and feasible paths.
    - Define and obtain (from first principles) Optimal flows.
    - Define and obtain (from first principles) Nash flows.
    - Define the potential function.
    - Define marginal costs.
    - State and use the theorem connecting the Nash flow to the optimal flow.
    - State and use the theorem connecting optimal flows to Nash flows.
