There are various areas of Game theory that are suited to computer programming.

The two areas that naturally sit in this course are:

- The computation of equilibria;
- The study of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

## A quick refresher of using Python

Note that this refresher uses **Python 3** and will also go over the use of
external libraries.

- Installing Anaconda.
- Basics of Python using Jupyter notebooks.
- External libraries.

## Computation of equilibria

To compute equilibria there are 3 pieces of software available to you:

1. Cloud.sagemath (using Sage).
2. NashPy (a standalone Python library).
3. Gambit (a piece of software with a Python interface): []().

## Studying the Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma
