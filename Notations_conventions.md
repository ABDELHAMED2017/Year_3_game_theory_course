- $r_i,s_i$: used to denote elements of $S_1$ and $S_2$ in normal form games with $N=2$.
- $\Delta S_i$: the set of mixed strategies of player $i$.
- $\sigma_i$: used to denote an element of $\Delta S_i$.
- $x,y$: used to denote an unkown in a mixed strategy.
- $s^*$: used to denote a best response in a normal form game.
- $UD_i$: used to denote the set of undominated strategies in a normal form game.
- $B_i$: used to denote the set of strategies that are a best response to some strategy.
- $\tau$: used to denote a strategy profile.
- $\tilde s$: used to denote a nash strategy in a normal form game.
