using a programming language.

You are free to use any software you want but I suggest:

- Cloud.sagemath: for computation of Nash equilibria of Normal form games;
- Nashpy: for computation of Nash equilibria of Normal form games in Python;
- Axelrod: for the study of the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma.

## Marking critera

### Scope 50%

Your understanding of the subject.

### Presentation 25%

## Remarks

The choice of subject is yours, here are two potential general subjects:

- Prove and illustrate a theorem from the notes (or otherwise);
- Model a real world scenario using game theory.
