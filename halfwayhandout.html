<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The whole idea behind game theory:</p>
<p><em>What happens to me depends on what I do but also on what everyone else does.</em></p>
<p>What did we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>We played the 2/3rds of the average game.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I need to be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Define an extensive form game and represent a game in extensive form;</li>
<li>Define an information set.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Normal Form Games:</p>
<p>Also called bi-matrix games. This is often used to represent situations in which players make decisions at the same time (and have a finite strategy set).</p>
<p>What did we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>We played some matching pennies games (I blogged about the results, links are in the discussion boards).</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I need to be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a normal form game;</li>
<li>Calculate expected utility with mixed strategies;</li>
<li>Plot expected utilities against/with pure strategies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dominance:</p>
<p>The idea of being able to 'remove' strategies that will never be played.</p>
<p>What did we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing too exciting.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I need to be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Define dominated strategies (strict and weak);</li>
<li>Define Common knowledge of rationality;</li>
<li>Predict rational behaviour using iterated removal of dominated strategies;</li>
<li>Recognise games that cannot be approached using this tactic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Best responses:</p>
<p>The idea of doing what 'I' should do <strong>if</strong> I know what 'you' would do.</p>
<p>What did we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>We played a game similar to Golden balls in class. (I blogged about it, link in the discussion board)</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I need to be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify best responses in pure strategies (underline stuff);</li>
<li>Identify best responses against mixed strategies;</li>
<li>Define the sets <span class="math"><em>U</em><em>D</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>B</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>;</li>
<li>State and prove certain cases of theorems connecting these two sets.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Nash equilibria in pure strategies:</p>
<p>Here we are officially defining what we meant by 'predicted rational behaviour'. In essence: 'not having a reason to change what you are doing'.</p>
<p>What did we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing too exciting.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I need to be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Give definition of Nash Equilibria in pure strategies;</li>
<li>Continue to use best responses to identify these;</li>
<li>Calculate Nash equilibria in pure strategies when strategy sets are <strong>continuous</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Nash equilibria in mixed strategies:</p>
<p>Congratulations we're now doing real game theory.</p>
<p>What did we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>We played a Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock game in class (I blogged about it, link on a discussion board).</li>
<li>The weak after seeing this we played against a random number generator (I blogged about that too, link in the same place).</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I need to be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Define Nash equilibrium (completely, ie in mixed strategies);</li>
<li>Identify Nash equilibrium using best responses against mixed strategies;</li>
<li>State and prove the Equality of Payoffs theorem;</li>
<li>Apply the equality of Payoffs theorem;</li>
<li>State and prove specific cases of Nash's theorem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Extensive form games (again):</p>
<p>We go back to the tree things and get a bit more precise.</p>
<p>What did we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>We played the centipede game but I'll come back to that when we talk about subgames.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I need to be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize valid extensive form games;</li>
<li>Define sequential rationality;</li>
<li>Define backwards induction;</li>
<li>Prove the theorem of existence of Nash equilibrium in games of perfect information;</li>
<li>Solve extensive form games using backwards induction;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Subgame perfection:</p>
<p>We connect Normal form games and extensive form games and define a stronger type of equilibrium condition.</p>
<p>What did we do?</p>
<ul>
<li>We played the centipede game and analysed the equilibrium strategies: everyone should take <strong>AT ALL STAGES</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I need to be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Write down the normal form representation of an extensive form game;</li>
<li>Define a subgame;</li>
<li>Define subgame perfect equilibria;</li>
<li>Obtain subgame perfect equilibria in games.</li>
</ul></li>
