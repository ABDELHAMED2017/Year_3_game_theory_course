<p>Identify all evolutionary stable strategies.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Consider the following game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a mathematics department, researchers can choose to use one of two systems for typesetting their research papers: LaTeX or Word. We will refer to these two strategies as <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math">\(W\)</span> respectively. A user of <span class="math">\(W\)</span> receives a basic utility of 1 and as <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is more widely used by mathematicians out of the department and is in general considered to be a better system a user of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> gets a basic utility of <span class="math">\(\alpha &gt; 1\)</span>. Members of the mathematics department often collaborate and as such it is beneficial for the researchers to use the same typesetting system. If we let <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> represent the proportion of users of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> we let:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[u(L,\chi)=\alpha+2\mu\]</span> <span class="math">\[u(W,\chi)=1+2(1-\mu)\]</span></p>
<p>What are the evolutionary stable strategies?</p>
<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>
<p>Using the theorem for necessity of stability we have the following candidate ESS:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(\sigma_L\)</span>: everyone uses <span class="math">\(L\)</span>, thus <span class="math">\(\mu=1\)</span> (we have <span class="math">\(u(L,\chi)&gt;u(W,\chi)\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\sigma_W\)</span>: everyone uses <span class="math">\(W\)</span>, thus <span class="math">\(\mu=0\)</span> (we have <span class="math">\(u(L,\chi)&lt;u(W,\chi)\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\sigma_m\)</span>: some use <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and some use <span class="math">\(W\)</span>, by the theorem we have <span class="math">\(u(L,\chi)=u(W,\chi)\)</span> which implies <span class="math">\(\alpha+2\mu=1+2(1-\mu)\)</span> giving <span class="math">\(\mu=\frac{3-\alpha}{4}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we consider the post entry population <span class="math">\(\chi_\epsilon=(1-\epsilon)\sigma^*+\epsilon\sigma\)</span> (where <span class="math">\(\sigma^*\)</span> is the base strategy and <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is the entry population). We denote <span class="math">\(\sigma=(\mu,1-\mu)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma^*=(\mu^*,1-\mu^*)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\delta = u(\sigma^*,\chi_\epsilon)-u(\sigma,\chi_\epsilon)\)</span>. We have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\delta = \mu^*u(L,\chi_\epsilon)+(1-\mu^*)u(W,\chi_\epsilon))-\mu u(L,\chi_\epsilon)+(1-\mu)u(W,\chi_\epsilon))=(\mu^*-\mu)(u(L,\chi_\epsilon)-u(W,\chi_\epsilon))
\]</span></p>
<p>which gives:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\delta = (\mu^*-\mu)(\alpha-3+4((1-\epsilon)\mu^*+\epsilon\mu))=(\mu^*-\mu)(4\mu^*+\alpha-3+4\epsilon(\mu-\mu^*))
\]</span></p>
<p>We now consider each potential ESS in turn, if <span class="math">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\epsilon&lt;\bar\epsilon\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(\bar\epsilon\)</span> then we have an ESS (this is by definition):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(\mu^*=1\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\delta=(1-\mu)(1+\alpha+4\epsilon(\mu-1))&gt;(1-\mu)(1+\alpha-4\epsilon)&gt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\mu\ne1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\epsilon&lt;\bar\epsilon=\frac{1+\alpha}{4}\)</span>. Thus <span class="math">\(\sigma_L\)</span> is an ESS.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\mu^*=0\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\delta=-\mu(\alpha - 3+4\epsilon\mu)\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(\alpha\geq 3\)</span> then <span class="math">\(\delta \leq 0\)</span> for all values of <span class="math">\(\mu, \epsilon\)</span>, thus if <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is 3 times better than <span class="math">\(W\)</span> <span class="math">\(\sigma_W\)</span> is not an ESS. If <span class="math">\(\alpha&lt;3\)</span> <span class="math">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span> <span class="math">\(\Leftrightarrow\)</span> <span class="math">\(\alpha-3+4\epsilon\mu&lt;0\)</span> <span class="math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math">\(\alpha-3+4\epsilon\mu&lt;\alpha-3+4\epsilon&lt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\mu\ne 0\)</span> <span class="math">\(\epsilon&lt;\bar\epsilon=\frac{3-\alpha}{4}\)</span>. Thus <span class="math">\(\sigma_W\)</span> is an ESS for <span class="math">\(\alpha&lt;3\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\mu^*=\frac{3-\alpha}{4}\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\delta=-4\epsilon\left(\frac{3-\alpha}{4}-\mu\right)^2&lt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\mu\ne\frac{3-\alpha}{4}\)</span> and for all <span class="math">\(\epsilon&gt;0\)</span> so <span class="math">\(\sigma_m\)</span> is not an ESS.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Consider the simple game with two players: an insurer and a driver. The insurer sets a premium price <span class="math">\(K\geq 0\)</span>, once that is done the driver can choose to buy insurance or not. It is assumed that the driver will have an accident with probability <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, if the driver has an accident the financial cost is <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Represent this game in normal form and obtain the Nash equilibrium for the game as a function of the parameters. Modify your analysis assuming that the utility function to the driver is given by <span class="math">\(u(x)=x^{1/\alpha}\)</span> and the utility to the insurer is given by <span class="math">\(u(x)=x^{1/\beta}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the analysis of the principal agent game assuming that <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is the probability of the project being successful in case of a high level of effort by the employee.</p></li>
