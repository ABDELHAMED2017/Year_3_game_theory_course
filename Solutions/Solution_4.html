<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Consider the pairwise contest games with the following associated two player games:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(2,2)&amp;(4,5)\\
(5,4)&amp;(1,1)\\
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Using the Equality of payoffs theorem we obtain the Nash equilibria:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\left\{((1,0),(0,1)),((0,1),(1,0)),((1/2,1/2),(1/2,1/2))\right\}\]</span></p>
<p>The two pure Nash equilibria are not ESS (because they are not symmetric).</p>
<p>for <span class="math">\(\sigma=(\omega,1-\omega)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u((1/2,1/2),\sigma)=\omega+2-2\omega+5\omega/2+(1-\omega)/2=\omega+5/2\]</span></p>
<p>and:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(\sigma,\sigma)=(2\omega^2+9(1-\omega)\omega+(1-\omega)^2)\]</span></p>
<p>thus (after some algebraic manipulation):</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u((1/2,1/2), \sigma) - u(\sigma,\sigma) =\frac{3}{2} \, {\left(2 \, w - 1\right)}^{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>which is positive for <span class="math">\(\omega \ne 1/2\)</span> so this mixed strategy is an ESS.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(1,1)&amp;(0,0)\\
(0,0)&amp;(1,1)
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Using the Equality of payoffs theorem we obtain the Nash equilibria:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\left\{((1,0),(1,0)),((0,1),(0,1)),((1/2,1/2),(1/2,1/2))\right\}\]</span></p>
<p>The two pure Nash equilibria are ESS (because of the first condition of the theorem relating an evolutionary stable strategy to the Nash equilibrium of the associated game).</p>
<p>As before:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u((1/2,1/2),\sigma)=1/2\]</span></p>
<p>and:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u((1/2,1/2), \sigma) - u(\sigma,\sigma) = -1/2(2\omega-1)^2\]</span></p>
<p>so not an ESS.</p>
<p>Identify all evolutionary stable strategies.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the following game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a mathematics department, researchers can choose to use one of two systems for typesetting their research papers: LaTeX or Word. We will refer to these two strategies as <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math">\(W\)</span> respectively. A user of <span class="math">\(W\)</span> receives a basic utility of 1 and as <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is more widely used by mathematicians out of the department and is in general considered to be a better system a user of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> gets a basic utility of <span class="math">\(\alpha &gt; 1\)</span>. Members of the mathematics department often collaborate and as such it is beneficial for the researchers to use the same typesetting system. If we let <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> represent the proportion of users of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> we let:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[u(L,\chi)=\alpha+2\mu\]</span> <span class="math">\[u(W,\chi)=1+2(1-\mu)\]</span></p>
<p>What are the evolutionary stable strategies?</p>
<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>
<p>Using the theorem for necessity of stability we have the following candidate ESS:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(\sigma_L\)</span>: everyone uses <span class="math">\(L\)</span>, thus <span class="math">\(\mu=1\)</span> (we have <span class="math">\(u(L,\chi)&gt;u(W,\chi)\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\sigma_W\)</span>: everyone uses <span class="math">\(W\)</span>, thus <span class="math">\(\mu=0\)</span> (we have <span class="math">\(u(L,\chi)&lt;u(W,\chi)\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\sigma_m\)</span>: some use <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and some use <span class="math">\(W\)</span>, by the theorem we have <span class="math">\(u(L,\chi)=u(W,\chi)\)</span> which implies <span class="math">\(\alpha+2\mu=1+2(1-\mu)\)</span> giving <span class="math">\(\mu=\frac{3-\alpha}{4}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we consider the post entry population <span class="math">\(\chi_\epsilon=(1-\epsilon)\sigma^*+\epsilon\sigma\)</span> (where <span class="math">\(\sigma^*\)</span> is the base strategy and <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is the entry population). We denote <span class="math">\(\sigma=(\mu,1-\mu)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma^*=(\mu^*,1-\mu^*)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\delta = u(\sigma^*,\chi_\epsilon)-u(\sigma,\chi_\epsilon)\)</span>. We have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\delta = \mu^*u(L,\chi_\epsilon)+(1-\mu^*)u(W,\chi_\epsilon))-\mu u(L,\chi_\epsilon)+(1-\mu)u(W,\chi_\epsilon))=(\mu^*-\mu)(u(L,\chi_\epsilon)-u(W,\chi_\epsilon))
\]</span></p>
<p>which gives:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\delta = (\mu^*-\mu)(\alpha-3+4((1-\epsilon)\mu^*+\epsilon\mu))=(\mu^*-\mu)(4\mu^*+\alpha-3+4\epsilon(\mu-\mu^*))
\]</span></p>
<p>We now consider each potential ESS in turn, if <span class="math">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\epsilon&lt;\bar\epsilon\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(\bar\epsilon\)</span> then we have an ESS (this is by definition):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(\mu^*=1\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\delta=(1-\mu)(1+\alpha+4\epsilon(\mu-1))&gt;(1-\mu)(1+\alpha-4\epsilon)&gt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\mu\ne1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\epsilon&lt;\bar\epsilon=\frac{1+\alpha}{4}\)</span>. Thus <span class="math">\(\sigma_L\)</span> is an ESS.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\mu^*=0\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\delta=-\mu(\alpha - 3+4\epsilon\mu)\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(\alpha\geq 3\)</span> then <span class="math">\(\delta \leq 0\)</span> for all values of <span class="math">\(\mu, \epsilon\)</span>, thus if <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is 3 times better than <span class="math">\(W\)</span> <span class="math">\(\sigma_W\)</span> is not an ESS. If <span class="math">\(\alpha&lt;3\)</span> <span class="math">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span> <span class="math">\(\Leftrightarrow\)</span> <span class="math">\(\alpha-3+4\epsilon\mu&lt;0\)</span> <span class="math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math">\(\alpha-3+4\epsilon\mu&lt;\alpha-3+4\epsilon&lt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\mu\ne 0\)</span> <span class="math">\(\epsilon&lt;\bar\epsilon=\frac{3-\alpha}{4}\)</span>. Thus <span class="math">\(\sigma_W\)</span> is an ESS for <span class="math">\(\alpha&lt;3\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\mu^*=\frac{3-\alpha}{4}\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\delta=-4\epsilon\left(\frac{3-\alpha}{4}-\mu\right)^2&lt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\mu\ne\frac{3-\alpha}{4}\)</span> and for all <span class="math">\(\epsilon&gt;0\)</span> so <span class="math">\(\sigma_m\)</span> is not an ESS.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Consider the following two normal form games:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[A=\begin{pmatrix}
(3,0)&amp;(-1,-1)&amp;(1,2)\\
(1,0)&amp;(-1,1)&amp;(2,0)\\
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[B=\begin{pmatrix}
(2,2)&amp;(1,1)&amp;(1,3)\\
(1,3)&amp;(-2,-3)&amp;(4,2)\\
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Assume both players play either game <span class="math">\(A\)</span> or game <span class="math">\(B\)</span> with probability <span class="math">\(1/2\)</span>, neither player knows which game is played. Obtain the Nash equilibrium for this game.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The described game is akin to the following game:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{pmatrix}
(5/2,1) &amp; (0,0) &amp; (1,5/2)\\
(1,3/2) &amp; (-3/2,-1) &amp; (3,1)\\
\end{pmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>We see that <span class="math">\(s_2\)</span> is dominated and solve the game using the equality of payoffs theorem to give the following Nash equilibrium: <span class="math">\[((1/4,3/4), (4/7,3/7))\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the analysis of the principal agent game assuming that <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is the probability of the project being successful in case of a high level of effort by the employee.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>What are the expected utilities to the employer and the employee?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Repeating the analysis, we see that the employee will carry out a high effort iff:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[p(\omega+B-1)^\alpha+(1-p)(\omega-1)^\alpha\geq \omega^\alpha\]</span></p>
<p>Following the same argument as in the notes we arrive at:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[p(\omega+B-1)^\alpha+(1-p)(\omega-1)^\alpha=1= \omega\]</span></p>
<p>thus:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\beta=(1/p)^(1/\alpha)\]</span></p>
<p>The utilities are then:</p>
<p>Employer: <span class="math">\[p(K-1-(1/p)^(1/\alpha))+(1-p)(\kappa-1)\]</span> Employee: <span class="math">\[1\]</span></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Obtain a condition for which the employer should offer a bonus.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>If no bonus is offered the employee has no incentive for a high effort thus <span class="math">\(\kappa=\omega=1\)</span>, thus the employer should offer a bonus iff:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[p(K-1-(1/p)^(1/\alpha))+(1-p)(\kappa-1)\geq 0\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Obtain the Markov Nash equilibrium (in pure strategies if it exists) for the following games assuming <span class="math">\(\delta=1/4\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Solutions/images/E04-img01.png" /><br /> <strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>State <span class="math">\(y\)</span> gives no value to either player so we only need to consider state <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Let the future gains to player 1 in state <span class="math">\(x\)</span> be <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and the future gains to player 2 in state <span class="math">\(x\)</span> be <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. Thus the players are facing the following game:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(3+3u/40, 2+3v/40) &amp; (1+u/20, 7+v/20)\\
(2, 1) &amp; (6+u/4, 3+v/4)
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>There are four possible equilibria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math">\((a,c)\)</span> which requires: <span class="math">\(3+3u/40\geq 2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(2+3v/40\geq 7+v/20\)</span> <span class="math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math">\(u\geq -40/3\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\geq 200\)</span>. However if this is the equilibria then <span class="math">\(u=120/37\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v=80/37\)</span> which contradicts the constraints.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\((a,d)\)</span> which requires: <span class="math">\(1+u/20\geq 6+u/4\)</span> and <span class="math">\(2+3v/40\leq 7+v/20\)</span> <span class="math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math">\(u\leq -25\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\leq 200\)</span>. However if this is the equilibria then <span class="math">\(u=20/19\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v=140/19\)</span> which contradicts the constraints.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\((b,c)\)</span> which requires: <span class="math">\(2\geq 3+3u/40\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\geq 3+v/4\)</span> <span class="math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math">\(u\leq -40/3\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\leq -8\)</span>. However if this is the equilibria then <span class="math">\(u=2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v=1\)</span> which contradicts the constraints.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\((b,d)\)</span> which requires: <span class="math">\(6+u/4\geq 1+u/20\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\leq 3+v/4\)</span> <span class="math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math">\(u\geq -25\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\geq -8\)</span>. However if this is the equilibria then <span class="math">\(u=8\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v=4\)</span> which <strong>does not</strong> contradict the constraints.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus <span class="math">\((b,d)\)</span> is the unique pure strategy equilibrium.</p>
<p><img src="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Solutions/images/E04-img02.png" /><br /> <strong>Solution</strong></p>
