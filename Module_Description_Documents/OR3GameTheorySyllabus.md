OR 3: (Game Theory) Syllabus

CATALOGUE ENTRY:

Game Theory is the mathematical study of multiple interactive agent
decision making. The applications of Game Theory are diverse including:
economics, biology as well as politics. Most of the problems arising in
Game Theory can be described very simply but often need complex methods
to solve.

This part of the module provides an introduction to Game Theory through
notions such as Nash Equilibria, Evolutionary Game Theory and Bayesian
Games. Games will be played throughout this part of the course by the
students and certain solution concepts will be explored in computer
labs.

AIMS OF THE MODULE:

To introduce students to concepts of Game Theory.

LEARNING OUTCOMES OF THE MODULE:

Knowledge and Understanding:

On completion of the module a student should be able to:

1.  Represent Games in both Extensive Form and Normal Form.
2.  Understand concepts linked to mixed strategies.

3.  Compute dominant strategies.
4.  Identify best responses.
5.  Define and compute Nash Equilibria.

6.  Understand and carry out backward induction.
7.  Understand concepts of subgame perfection.
8.  Compute equilibria and best responses in repeated games.

9.  Understand concepts of Evolutionary Game Theory
10. Compute Evolutionary Stable Strategies

11. Represent incomplete information games
12. Understand concepts of Bayesian Nash Equilibria and
    Rationalizability

Transferable Skills:

Improves skills involved in problem solving, logical thinking and
mathematical formulation of problems.  Also provides knowledge and use
of some programming.  All sought after skills in the management and
business world.

METHODS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING:

27 hours lecture/practical classes.

Students are also expected to undertake at least 50 hours private study
including:

1.  Preparation of worked solutions for tutorial classes and computer
    labs.
2.  Self study of certain topics.

ASSESSMENT:

METHOD(S) OF SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT:

This all looks good to me Vince.  Obviously next step is to combine with
what Jeff wishes to include and ensure the overall module spec appears
'smooth' and coherent.  Just one observation for now in relation to your
weekly plan - I do believe these double modules are taught in one
semester i.e. 4 lectures per week, so quite intense and means you will
both have 5-6 weeks each.  Cheers, Paul.

Vincent Knight:

Thanks Paul, as you say obviously will ne to combine with Jeff etc...

Thanks also for info as to how the teaching will be spread. I'll revise
my schedule accordingly. Looking forward to teaching it to be honest! :)

Hope all is well,

Vince
