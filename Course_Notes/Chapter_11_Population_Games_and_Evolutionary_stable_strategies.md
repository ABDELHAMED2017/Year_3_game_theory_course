# OR 3: Chapter 11 - Population Games and Evolutionary stable strategies

## Recap

In the [previous chapter](Chapter_11_Infinitely_Repeated_Games.pdf):

- We considered infinitely repeated games using a discount rate;
- We proved a powerful result stating that for a high enough discount rate player would cooperate.

In this chapter we'll start looking at a fascinating new area of game theory.

## Population Games

In this chapter (and the next) we will be looking at an area of game theory that looks at the evolution of strategic behaviour in a population.

### Definition

---

Considering an infinite population of individuals each of which represents a strategy from $\Delta S$, we define the population profile as a vector $x\in[0,1]^{|S|}_\mathbb{R}$. Note that:

$$\sum_{s\in S}x(s)=1$$

---

It is important to note that $x$ does not correspond to any strategy adopted by any individual.

### Example

Consider a population with $S=\{s_1,s_2\}$. If we assume that every individual plays $\sigma=(.25,.75)$ then $x=\sigma$. However if we assume that .25 of the population play $\sigma_1=(1,0)$ and .75 play $\sigma_2=(0,1)$ then $x=\sigma$.

In evolutionary game theory we must consider the _utility_ of a particular strategy when played in a particular population profile denoted by $u(s,x)$ for $s\in S$.

Thus the utility to a player playing $\sigma\in\Delta S$ in a population $x$:

$$u(s,x)=\sum_{s\in S}\sigma(s)u(s,x)$$

The interpretation of the above is:

> **These payoffs represent the number of descendants that each type of individual has.**

### Example

If we consider a population of N individuals in which $S=\{s_1,s_2\}$. Assume that .5 of the population use each strategy so that $x=(.5,.5)$ and assume that for the current population profile we have:

$$u(s_1,x)=3\text{ and }u(s_2,x)=7$$

In the next generation we will have $3N/2$ individuals using $s_1$ and $5N/2$ using $s_2$ so that the strategy profile of the next generation will be $(.3,.7)$.

We are going to work towards understanding the evolutionary dynamics of given populations. If we consider $x^*$ to be the startegy profile where all members of the population play $\sigma^*$ then a population will be evolutionary stable only if:

$$\sigma^*\in\text{argmax}_{\sigma\in\Delta S}u(\sigma,x)$$

Ie at equilibrium $\sigma^*$ must be a best response to the population profile it generates.

### Theorem

---

In a population game, consider $\sigma^*\in\Delta S$ and the population profile $x$ generated by $\sigma^*$. If the population is stable then:

$$u(s,x)=u(\sigma,x)\text{ for all }s\in\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)$$

---

(Recall that $\mathcal{S}(s)$ denotes the support of $s$.

### Proof

---

If $|\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)|=1$ then the proof is trivial.

We assume that $|\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)|>1$. Let us assume that the theorem is not true so that there exists $\bar s\in\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)$ such that:

$$u(\sigma^*,x)\ne u(\bar s,x)$$

We have $u(\sigma^*,x)=\sum_{s\in \mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)}\sigma^*(s)u(s,x)$ so we can assume without loss of generality that:

$$u(\sigma^*,x)< u(\bar s,x)$$

which implies that the population is not stable.

---

## Evolutionary Stable Strategies

### Definition

---

Consider a population where all individuals initially play $\sigma^*$. If we assume that a small proportion $\epsilon$ start playing $\sigma$. The new population is called the **post entry population** and will be denoted by $x_{\epsilon}$.

---

### Example

Consider a population with $S=\{s_1,s_2\}$ and initial population profile $x=(1/2,1/2)$. If we assume that $\sigma=(1/3,2/3)$ is introduced in to the population then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_{\epsilon}&=(1-\epsilon)(1/2,1/2)+\epsilon\sigma\\
            &=(1/2-\epsilon/3,1/2+2\epsilon/3)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Definition

---

A strategy $\sigma^*\in\Delta S$ is called an **Evolutionary Stable Strategy** if there exists an $0<\bar\epsilon<1$ such that for every $0<\epsilon<\bar \epsilon$ and every $\sigma\ne \sigma^*$:

$$u(\sigma^*,x)>u(\sigma,x)$$

---

Before we go any further we must consider two types of population games:

1. Games against the field. In this setting we assume that no individual has a specific adversary but has a utility that depends on what the rest of the individuals are doing.
2. Pairwise contest games. In this setting we assume that every individual is continiously assigned to _play_ against another individual.

The differences between these two types of population games will hopefully become clear soon.

## Games against the field

We will now consider an example of a game against the field. The main difficulty with these games is that the utility $u(s,x)$ is not generally linear in $x$.

Let us consider the Male to Female ratio in a population, let us make the following assumptions:

1. The proportion of Males in the population is $\alpha$ and the proportion of females is $1-\alpha$;
2. Each female has a single mate and has $n$ offspring;
3. Males have on average $(1-\alpha)/\alpha$ mates;
4. Females are solely responsible for the sex of the offspring.

We assume that $S=\{M,F\}$ so that females can either only produce Males or only produce Females. Thus, a general mixed strategy $\sigma=(\omega,1-\omega)$ produces a population with a proportion of  $\omega$ males. Furthermore we can write $x=(\mu,1-\mu)$.

The females are the decision makers so that we consider them as the individuals in our population. The immediate offspring of the females $n$ is constant and so cannot be used as a utility. We use the second generation offspring:

$$
\begin{aligned}
u(M,x)&=n^2\frac{1-\mu}{\mu}\\
u(F,x)&=n^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus:

$$u(\sigma,x)=n^2\left(\omega\frac{(1-\mu)}{\mu}+(1-\omega)\right)$$

Let us try and find an ESS for this game:

1. If $\mu\ne 1/2$ then $u(M,x)\ne u(F,x)$ so that any mixed strategy $\sigma$ with support $\{M,F\}$ would not give a stable population.
2. Thus we need to check if $\sigma^*=(1/2,1/2)$ is an ESS (this is the only candidate).

We consider some mutation $\sigma=(p,1-p)$:

$$x_{\epsilon}=(1-\epsilon)\sigma^*+\epsilon\sigma$$

which implies:

$$\mu_{\epsilon}=(1-\epsilon)1/2+p\epsilon=1/2+\epsilon(p-1/2)$$

We have:

$$u(\sigma^*,x_{\epsilon})=1/2+\frac{1-\mu_{\epsilon}}{2\mu_{\epsilon}}$$

and:

$$u(\sigma,x_{\epsilon})=(1-p)+p\frac{1-\mu_{\epsilon}}{\mu_{\epsilon}}$$

The difference:

$$
\begin{aligned}
u(\sigma^*,x_{\epsilon})-u(\sigma,x_{\epsilon})&=p-1/2+(1/2-p)\frac{1-\mu_{\epsilon}}{\mu_{\epsilon}}\\
&=(1/2-p)\frac{1-2\mu_{\epsilon}}{\mu_{\epsilon}}
\end{aligned}
$$

We note that if $p<1/2$ then $\mu_{\epsilon}<2$ which implies that $u(\sigma^*,x_{\epsilon})-u(\sigma,x_{\epsilon})>0$. Similarly if $p>1/2$ then $\mu_{\epsilon}<2$ which implies that $u(\sigma^*,x_{\epsilon})-u(\sigma,x_{\epsilon})>0$. Thus $\sigma^*$ is a ESS.
