<h1 id="or-3-chapter-10---infinitely-repeated-games">OR 3: Chapter 10 - Infinitely Repeated Games</h1>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>In the <a href="Chapter_10_Infinitely_Repeated_Games.html">previous chapter</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We considered infinitely repeated games using a discount factor;</li>
<li>We proved a theorem stating that for a high enough discount factor players could end up cooperating.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter we'll move on to a fascinating area of game theory.</p>
<h2 id="discounting">Discounting</h2>
<p>When considering infinitely repeated games (\(T\to\infty\)) it is easiest to consider a Prisoners dilemma throughout:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{pmatrix}
(2,2)&amp;(0,3)\\
(3,0)&amp;(1,1)
\end{pmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>Let us denote \(s_{1}\) as the strategy &quot;cooperate at every stage&quot;. Let us denote \(s_{2}\) as the strategy &quot;defect at every stage&quot;.</p>
<p>If we assume that both players play \(s_{1}\) their utility would be:</p>
<p>\[U_1(s_{1},s_{1})=U_2(s_{1},s_{1})=\sum_{i=1}^\infty2&gt;\infty\]</p>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<p>\[U_1(s_{2},s_{2})=U_2(s_{1},s_{1})=\sum_{i=1}^\infty1&gt;\infty\]</p>
<p>It is impossible to compare these two strategies. To be able to carry out analysis of strategies in infinitely repeated games we make use of a <strong>discounting factor</strong> \(0&lt;\delta&lt;1\).</p>
<p>The interpretation of \(\delta\) is that there is less importance given to future payoffs. One way of thinking about this is that &quot;the probability of recieveing the future payoffs decreases with time&quot;.</p>
<p>In this case we write the utility in an infinitely repeated game as:</p>
<p>\[U_i(r,s)=\sum_{t=1}^\infty\delta^{t-1}u_i{t}\]</p>
<p>Thus:</p>
<p>\[U_1(s_{1},s_{1})=U_1(s_{1},s_{1})=2\sum_{i=1}^\infty\delta^{t-1}=2/(1-\delta)\]</p>
<p>and:</p>
<p>\[U_1(s_{2},s_{2})=U_1(s_{1},s_{1})=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\delta^{t-1}=1/(1-\delta)\]</p>
<h2 id="conditions-for-cooperation-in-prisoners-dilemmas">Conditions for cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas</h2>
<p>Let us consider the &quot;Grimm trigger&quot; strategy (which we denote \(s_G\)):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start by cooperating until your opponent defects at which point defect in all future stages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If both players play \(s_G\) we have \(s_G=s_1\):</p>
<p>\[U_1(s_{G},s_{G})=U_1(s_{G},s_{G})=2/(1-\delta)\]</p>
<p>If we assume that \(S_1=S_2=\{s_1,s_2,s_G\}\) and player 2 deviates from \(S_G\) to \(s_2\) we get:</p>
<p>\[U_2(s_{1},s_{G})=3+\sum_{t=2}^{\infty}\delta^{t-1}=3+\delta/(1-\delta)\]</p>
<p>Deviation from \(s_1\) to \(s_G\) is rational if and only if:</p>
<p>\[2/(1-\delta)\geq 3+\delta(1-\delta)\] \[\Leftrightarrow\] \[\delta\geq 1/2\]</p>
<p>thus if \(\delta\) is large enough \((s_G,s_G)\) is a Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>Importantly \((s_G,s_G)\) is not a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. Consider the subgame following \((r_1,s_2)\) having been played in the first stage of the game. Assume that player 1 adhers to \(s_G\):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If player 2 also plays \(s_G\) then the first stage of the subgame will be \((r_2,s_1)\) (player 1 punishes while player 2 sticks with \(s_1\) as player 1 played \(r_1\) in previous stage). All subsequent plays will be \((r_2,s_2)\) so player 2's utility will be:</li>
</ol>
<p>\[0+\sum_{t=2}^{\infty}\delta^{t-1}=\delta/(1-\delta)\]</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If player 2 deviates from \(s_G\) and chooses to play \(D\) in every period of the subgame then player 2's utility will be:</li>
</ol>
<p>\[\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\delta^{t-1}=(1-\delta)\]</p>
<p>which is a rational deviation (as \(0&lt;\delta&lt;1\)).</p>
<p>Two questions arise:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Can we always find a strategy in a repeated game that gives us a better outcome than simply repeating the stage Nash equilibria? (Like \(s_G\))</li>
<li>Can we also find a strategy with the above property that in fact is subgame perfect? (Unlike \(s_G\))</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="folk-theorm">Folk theorm</h2>
<p>The answer is yes! To prove this we need to define a couple of things.</p>
<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<hr />
<p>If we interpret \(\delta\) as the probability of the repeated game ending then the <em>average</em> length of the game is:</p>
<p>\[\bar T=\frac{1}{1-\delta}\]</p>
<p>We can use this to define the <strong>average payoffs</strong> per stage:</p>
<p>\[\frac{1}{T}U_i(r,s)=(1-\delta)U_i(r,s)\]</p>
<hr />
<p>This average payoff is a tool that allows us to compare the payoffs in an infitely repeated game to the payoff in a single stage game.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="definition-1">Definition</h3>
<hr />
<p><strong>Individually rational payoffs</strong> are average payoffs that exceed the stage game Nash equilibrium payoff for both players.</p>
<hr />
<p>As an example consider the following plot corresponding to a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/L10-img01.png" /><p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<p>The feasible average payoffs correspond to the feasible payoffs in the stage game. The individually rational payoffs show the payoffs that are <strong>better for both players</strong> than the stag Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>The following theorem states that we can choose a particular discount rate that for which there exists a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium that would give any individually rational payoff pair!</p>
<h3 id="theorem">Theorem</h3>
<hr />
<p>Let \((u_1^*,u_2^*)\) be a pair of Nash equilibrium payoffs for a stage game. For every individually rational pair \((v_1,v_2)\) there exists \(\bar \delta\) such that for all \(\delta&gt;\bar \delta\) there is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium with payoffs \((v_1,v_2)\).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>
<p>Let \((\sigma_1^*,\sigma_2^*)\) be the stage Nash profile that yields \((u_1^*,u_2^*)\). Now assume that playing \(\bar\sigma_1\in\Delta S_1\) and \(\bar\sigma_2\in\Delta S_2\) in every stage gives \((v_1,v_2)\) (an individual rational payoff pair).</p>
<p>Consider the following strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Begin by using \(\bar \sigma_i\) and continue to use \(\bar \sigma_i\) as long as both players use the agreed strategies. If any player deviates: use \(\sigma_i^*\) for all future stages.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We begin by proving that the above is a Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>Without loss of generality if player 1 deviates to \(\sigma_1&#39;\in\Delta S_1\) such that \(u_1(\sigma_1&#39;,\bar \sigma_2)&gt;v_1\) in stage \(k\) then:</p>
<p>\[U_1^{(k)}=(k-1)v_1+u_1(\sigma_1&#39;,\bar \sigma_2)+u_1^*\left(\frac{1}{1-\delta}-\sum_{t=1}^{k}\delta^{t-1}\right)\]</p>
<p>Recalling that player 1 would receive \(v_1\) in every stage with no devitation, the biggest gain to be made from deviating is if player 1 deviates in the first stage (all future gains are more heavily discounted). Thus if we can find \(\bar\delta\) such that \(\delta&gt;\bar\delta\) implies that \(U_1^{(1)}\leq \frac{v_1}{1-q}\) then player 1 has no incentive to deviate.</p>
<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
U_1^{(1)}=u_1(\sigma_1&#39;,\bar\sigma_2)+u_1^*\frac{\delta}{1-\delta}&amp;\leq\frac{v_1}{1-\delta}\\
(1-\delta)u_1(\sigma_1&#39;,\bar\sigma_2)+u_1^*\delta&amp;\leq v_1\\
u_1(\sigma_1&#39;,\bar\sigma_2)-v_1&amp;\leq \delta(u_1^*(\sigma_1&#39;,\bar\sigma_2)-u_1^*)\\
\end{aligned}
\]</p>
<p>as \(u_1(\sigma_1&#39;,\bar \sigma_2)&gt;v_1&gt;u_1^*\), taking \(\bar\delta=\frac{u_1(\sigma_1&#39;,\bar\sigma_2)-v_1}{u_1(\sigma_1&#39;,\bar\sigma_2)-u_1^*}\) gives the required required result for player 1 and repeating the argument for player 2 completes the proof of the fact that the prescribed strategy is a Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>By construction this strategy is also a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. Given any history <strong>both</strong> players will act in the same way and no player will have an incentive to deviate:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we consider a subgame just after any player has deviated from \(\bar\sigma_i\) then both players use \(\sigma_i^*\).</li>
<li>If we consider a subgame just after no player has deviated from \(\sigma_i\) then both players continue to use \(\bar\sigma_i\).</li>
</ul>
