<ul>
<li>We considered infinitely repeated games using a discount rate;</li>

</ul>
<p>In this chapter we'll start looking at a fascinating area of game theory.</p>
<h2 id="population-games"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Population Games</h2>
<p>In this chapter (and the next) we will be looking at an area of game theory that looks at the evolution of strategic behaviour in a population.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-population-vector"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Definition of a population vector</h3>
<hr />
<p>Considering an infinite population of individuals each of which represents a strategy from <span class="math">\(\Delta S\)</span>, we define the population profile as a vector <span class="math">\(\chi\in[0,1]^{|S|}_\mathbb{R}\)</span>. Note that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_{s\in S}\chi(s)=1\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>It is important to note that <span class="math">\(\chi\)</span> does not necessarily correspond to any strategy adopted by particular any individual.</p>
<h3 id="example"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Example</h3>
<p>Consider a population with <span class="math">\(S=\{s_1,s_2\}\)</span>. If we assume that every individual plays <span class="math">\(\sigma=(.25,.75)\)</span> then <span class="math">\(\chi=\sigma\)</span>. However if we assume that .25 of the population play <span class="math">\(\sigma_1=(1,0)\)</span> and .75 play <span class="math">\(\sigma_2=(0,1)\)</span> then <span class="math">\(\chi=\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>In evolutionary game theory we must consider the <em>utility</em> of a particular strategy when played in a particular population profile denoted by <span class="math">\(u(s,\chi)\)</span> for <span class="math">\(s\in S\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus the utility to a player playing <span class="math">\(\sigma\in\Delta S\)</span> in a population <span class="math">\(\chi\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(\sigma,\chi)=\sum_{s\in S}\sigma(s)u(s,\chi)\]</span></p>
<p>The interpretation of the above is that <strong>these payoffs represent the number of descendants that each type of individual has.</strong></p>
<h3 id="example-1"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Example</h3>
<p>If we consider a population of N individuals in which <span class="math">\(S=\{s_1,s_2\}\)</span>. Assume that .5 of the population use each strategy so that <span class="math">\(\chi=(.5,.5)\)</span> and assume that for the current population profile we have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(s_1,\chi)=3\text{ and }u(s_2,\chi)=7\]</span></p>
<p>In the next generation we will have <span class="math">\(3N/2\)</span> individuals using <span class="math">\(s_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(7N/2\)</span> using <span class="math">\(s_2\)</span> so that the strategy profile of the next generation will be <span class="math">\((.3,.7)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We are going to work towards understanding the evolutionary dynamics of given populations. If we consider <span class="math">\(\chi^*\)</span> to be the startegy profile where all members of the population play <span class="math">\(\sigma^*\)</span> then a population will be evolutionary stable only if:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sigma^*\in\text{argmax}_{\sigma\in\Delta S}u(\sigma,\chi)\]</span></p>
<p>Ie at equilibrium <span class="math">\(\sigma^*\)</span> must be a best response to the population profile it generates.</p>
<h3 id="theorem-for-necessity-of-stability"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Theorem for necessity of stability</h3>
<hr />
<p>In a population game, consider <span class="math">\(\sigma^*\in\Delta S\)</span> and the population profile <span class="math">\(\chi\)</span> generated by <span class="math">\(\sigma^*\)</span>. If the population is stable then:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(s,\chi)=u(\sigma^*,\chi)\text{ for all }s\in\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>(Recall that <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}(s)\)</span> denotes the support of <span class="math">\(s\)</span>.)</p>
<h3 id="proof"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span> Proof</h3>
<hr />
<p>If <span class="math">\(|\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)|=1\)</span> then the proof is trivial.</p>
<p>We assume that <span class="math">\(|\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)|&gt;1\)</span>. Let us assume that the theorem is not true so that there exists <span class="math">\(\bar s\in\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)\)</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(\sigma^*,\chi)\ne u(\bar s,\chi)\]</span></p>
<p>Without loss of generality let us assume that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\bar s=\text{argmax}_{s\in\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)}u(s,\chi)\]</span></p>
<p>Thus we have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
u_{i}(\sigma^*,\chi)&amp;=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)}\sigma^*(s)u(s,\chi)\\
&amp;\leq\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)}\sigma^*(s)u(\bar s,\chi) \\
&amp;\leq u(\bar s,\chi)\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}(\sigma^*)}\sigma^*(s) \\
&amp;\leq u(\bar s,\chi)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Which gives:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(\sigma^*,\chi)&lt; u(\bar s,\chi)\]</span></p>
<p>which implies that the population is not stable.</p>

<h2 id="evolutionary-stable-strategies"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Evolutionary Stable Strategies</h2>
<h3 id="definition-of-an-evolutionary-stable-strategy"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Definition of an evolutionary stable strategy</h3>
<hr />
<p>Consider a population where all individuals initially play <span class="math">\(\sigma^*\)</span>. If we assume that a small proportion <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> start playing <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>. The new population is called the <strong>post entry population</strong> and will be denoted by <span class="math">\(\chi_{\epsilon}\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-2"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Example</h3>
<p>Consider a population with <span class="math">\(S=\{s_1,s_2\}\)</span> and initial population profile <span class="math">\(\chi=(1/2,1/2)\)</span>. If we assume that <span class="math">\(\sigma=(1/3,2/3)\)</span> is introduced in to the population then:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{aligned}
\chi_{\epsilon}&amp;=(1-\epsilon)(1/2,1/2)+\epsilon\sigma\\
            &amp;=(1/2-\epsilon/3,1/2+2\epsilon/3)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="definition"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Definition</h3>
<hr />
<p>A strategy <span class="math">\(\sigma^*\in\Delta S\)</span> is called an <strong>Evolutionary Stable Strategy</strong> if there exists an <span class="math">\(0&lt;\bar\epsilon&lt;1\)</span> such that for every <span class="math">\(0&lt;\epsilon&lt;\bar \epsilon\)</span> and every <span class="math">\(\sigma\ne \sigma^*\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(\sigma^*,\chi)&gt;u(\sigma,\chi)\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Before we go any further we must consider two types of population games:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Games against the field. In this setting we assume that no individual has a specific adversary but has a utility that depends on what the rest of the individuals are doing.</li>
<li>Pairwise contest games. In this setting we assume that every individual is continiously assigned to <em>play</em> against another individual.</li>
</ol>
<p>The differences between these two types of population games will hopefully become clear.</p>
<h2 id="games-against-the-field"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Games against the field</h2>
<p>We will now consider an example of a game against the field. The main difficulty with these games is that the utility <span class="math">\(u(s,\chi)\)</span> is not generally linear in <span class="math">\(\chi\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us consider the Male to Female ratio in a population, and make the following assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The proportion of Males in the population is <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and the proportion of females is <span class="math">\(1-\alpha\)</span>;</li>
<li>Each female has a single mate and has <span class="math">\(K\)</span> offspring;</li>
<li>Males have on average <span class="math">\((1-\alpha)/\alpha\)</span> mates;</li>
<li>Females are solely responsible for the sex of the offspring.</li>
</ol>
<p>We assume that <span class="math">\(S=\{M,F\}\)</span> so that females can either only produce Males or only produce Females. Thus, a general mixed strategy <span class="math">\(\sigma=(\omega,1-\omega)\)</span> produces a population with a proportion of <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> males. Furthermore we can write <span class="math">\(\chi=(\alpha,1-\alpha)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The females are the decision makers so that we consider them as the individuals in our population. The immediate offspring of the females <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is constant and so cannot be used as a utility. We use the second generation offspring:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{aligned}
u(M,\chi)&amp;=K^2\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\\
u(F,\chi)&amp;=K^2
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(\sigma,\chi)=K^2\left(\omega\frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha}+(1-\omega)\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Let us try and find an ESS for this game:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If <span class="math">\(\alpha\ne 1/2\)</span> then <span class="math">\(u(M,\chi)\ne u(F,\chi)\)</span> so that any mixed strategy <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> with support <span class="math">\(\{M,F\}\)</span> would not give a stable population.</li>
<li>Thus we need to check if <span class="math">\(\sigma^*=(1/2,1/2)\)</span> is an ESS (this is the only candidate).</li>
</ol>
<p>We consider some mutation <span class="math">\(\sigma=(p,1-p)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\chi_{\epsilon}=(1-\epsilon)\sigma^*+\epsilon\sigma\]</span></p>
<p>which implies:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\alpha{\epsilon}=(1-\epsilon)1/2+p\epsilon=1/2+\epsilon(p-1/2)\]</span></p>
<p>We have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(\sigma^*,\chi_{\epsilon})=1/2+\frac{1-\alpha_{\epsilon}}{2\alpha_{\epsilon}}\]</span></p>
<p>and:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u(\sigma,\chi_{\epsilon})=(1-p)+p\frac{1-\alpha_{\epsilon}}{\alpha_{\epsilon}}\]</span></p>
<p>The difference:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{aligned}
u(\sigma^*,\chi_{\epsilon})-u(\sigma,\chi_{\epsilon})&amp;=p-1/2+(1/2-p)\frac{1-\alpha_{\epsilon}}{\alpha_{\epsilon}}\\
&amp;=(1/2-p)\frac{1-2\alpha_{\epsilon}}{\alpha_{\epsilon}}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>We note that if <span class="math">\(p&lt;1/2\)</span> then <span class="math">\(\alpha_{\epsilon}&lt;2\)</span> which implies that <span class="math">\(u(\sigma^*,\chi_{\epsilon})-u(\sigma,\chi_{\epsilon})&gt;0\)</span>. Similarly if <span class="math">\(p&gt;1/2\)</span> then <span class="math">\(\alpha_{\epsilon}&lt;2\)</span> which implies that <span class="math">\(u(\sigma^*,\chi_{\epsilon})-u(\sigma,\chi_{\epsilon})&gt;0\)</span>. Thus <span class="math">\(\sigma^*=(1/2,1/2)\)</span> is a ESS.</p>
