<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>In the <a href="Chapter_08-Subgame_Perfection.html">previous chapter</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We looked at the connection between games in normal form and extensive form;</li>
<li>We defined a subgame;</li>
<li>We define a refinement of Nash equilibrium: subgame perfect equilibrium.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter we'll start looking at instances where games are repeated.</p>

<h3 id="theorem">Theorem</h3>
<hr />
<p>For any repeated game, any sequence of stage Nash profiles gives the outcome of a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.</p>
<hr />
<p>If we consider the strategy given by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Player \(i\) should play strategy \(\tilde s^{(k)}_i\) regardless of the play of any previous strategy profiles.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where \(\tilde s^{(k)}_i\) is the strategy played by player \(i\) in any stage Nash profile. The \(k\) is used to indicate that all players play strategies from the same stage Nash profile.</p>
<p>Using backwards induction we see that this strategy is a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore it is a stage Nash profile so it is a Nash equilibria for the last stage game which is the last subgame. If we consider (in an inductive way) each subsequent subgame the result holds.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Consider the following stage game:</p>
<p>\[\begin{pmatrix}
(1,3)&amp;(2,10)\\
(2,2)&amp;(4,1)\\
\end{pmatrix}\]</p>
<p>The following plot shows the various possible outcomes of the repeated game for \(T=2\):</p>

</div>
<p>If we consider the two pure equilibria \((r_1,s_2)\) and \((r_2,s_1)\), we have 4 possible outcomes that correspond to the outcome of a subgame perfect Nash equilibria:</p>
<p>\[(r_1r_1,s_2s_2)\text{ giving utility vector: }(4,20)\] \[(r_1r_2,s_2s_1)\text{ giving utility vector: }(4,12)\] \[(r_2r_1,s_1s_2)\text{ giving utility vector: }(4,12)\] \[(r_2r_2,s_1s_1)\text{ giving utility vector: }(4,4)\]</p>
<p>Importantly, not all subgame Nash equilibria outcomes are of the above form.</p>
