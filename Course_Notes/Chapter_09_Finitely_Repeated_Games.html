<h2 id="recap"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Recap</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Course_Notes/Chapter_08-Subgame_Perfection.html">previous chapter</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We looked at the connection between games in normal form and extensive form;</li>
<li>We defined a subgame;</li>
<li>We defined a refinement of Nash equilibrium: subgame perfect equilibrium.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter we'll start looking at instances where games are repeated.</p>
<h2 id="repeated-games"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Repeated games</h2>
<p>In game theory the term <strong>repeated game</strong> is well defined.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-repeated-game"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Definition of a repeated game</h3>
<hr />
<p>A repeated game is played over discrete time periods. Each time period is index by <span class="math">\(0&lt;t\leq T\)</span> where <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is the total number of periods.</p>
<p>In each period <span class="math">\(N\)</span> players play a static game referred to as the <strong>stage game</strong> independently and simultaneously selecting actions.</p>
<p>Players make decisions in full knowledge of the <strong>history</strong> of the game played so far (ie the actions chosen by each player in each previous time period).</p>
<p>The payoff is defined as the sum of the utilities in each stage game for every time period.</p>
<hr />
<p>As an example let us use the Prisoner's dilemma as the stage game (so we are assuming that we have 2 players playing repeatedly):</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{pmatrix}
(2,2)&amp;(0,3)\\
(3,0)&amp;(1,1)
\end{pmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>All possible outcomes to the repeated game given <span class="math">\(T=2\)</span> are shown.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>When we discuss strategies in repeated games we need to be careful.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-strategy-in-a-repeated-game"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Definition of a strategy in a repeated game</h3>
<hr />
<p>A repeated game strategy must specify the action of a player in a given stage game given the entire history of the repeated game.</p>
<hr />
<p>For example in the repeated prisoner's dilemma the following is a valid strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Start to cooperate and in every stage game simply repeat the action used by your opponent in the previous stage game.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus if both players play this strategy both players will cooperate throughout getting (in the case of <span class="math">\(T=2\)</span>) a utility of 4.</p>
<h2 id="subgame-perfect-nash-equilibrium-in-repeated-games"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in repeated games</h2>
<h3 id="theorem-of-a-sequence-of-stage-nash-profiles"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Theorem of a sequence of stage Nash profiles</h3>
<hr />
<p>For any repeated game, any sequence of stage Nash profiles gives the outcome of a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.</p>
<hr />
<p>Where by stage Nash profile we refer to a stationary profile that is a Nash Equilibrium in the stage game.</p>
<h3 id="proof"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Proof</h3>
<hr />
<p>If we consider the strategy given by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Player <span class="math">\(i\)</span> should play strategy <span class="math">\(\tilde s^{(k)}_i\)</span> regardless of the play of any previous strategy profiles.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\tilde s^{(k)}_i\)</span> is the strategy played by player <span class="math">\(i\)</span> in any stage Nash profile. The <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is used to indicate that all players play strategies from the same stage Nash profile.</p>
<p>Using backwards induction we see that this strategy is a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore it is a stage Nash profile so it is a Nash equilibria for the last stage game which is the last subgame. If we consider (in an inductive way) each subsequent subgame the result holds.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="example"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Example</h3>
<p>Consider the following stage game:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(2,3)&amp;(0,2)&amp;(1,4)\\
(0,1)&amp;(1,2)&amp;(0,0)\\
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>The plot shows the various possible outcomes of the repeated game for <span class="math">\(T=2\)</span>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Course_Notes/plots/L09-plot02.png" />
</div>
<p>If we consider the two pure equilibria <span class="math">\((r_1,s_3)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((r_2,s_2)\)</span>, we have 4 possible outcomes that correspond to the outcome of a subgame perfect Nash equilibria:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(r_1r_1,s_3s_3)\text{ giving utility vector: }(2,8)\]</span> <span class="math">\[(r_1r_2,s_3s_2)\text{ giving utility vector: }(2,6)\]</span> <span class="math">\[(r_2r_1,s_2s_3)\text{ giving utility vector: }(2,6)\]</span> <span class="math">\[(r_2r_2,s_2s_2)\text{ giving utility vector: }(2,4)\]</span></p>
<p>Importantly, not all subgame Nash equilibria outcomes are of the above form.</p>
<h2 id="reputation-in-repeated-games"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Reputation in repeated games</h2>
<p>By definition all subgame Nash equilibria <strong>must</strong> play a stage Nash profile in the last stage game. However can a strategy be found that does not play a Nash profile in earlier games?</p>
<p>Considering the above game, let us look at this strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Play <span class="math">\((r_1,s_1)\)</span> in the first period and then, as long as P2 cooperates play <span class="math">\((r_1,s_3)\)</span> in the second period. If P2 deviates from <span class="math">\(s_1\)</span> in the first period then play <span class="math">\((r_2,s_2)\)</span> in the second period.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly this strategy gives the utility vector: <span class="math">\((3,7)\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is this strategy profile a Nash equilibrium (for the entire game)?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Does player 1 have an incentive to deviate?</li>
</ul>
<p>No any other strategy played in any period would give a lower payoff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does player 2 have an incentive to deviate?</li>
</ul>
<p>If player 2 deviates in the first period, he/she can obtain 4 in the first period but will obtain 2 in the second. Thus a first period deviation increases the score by 1 but decreases the score in the second period by 2. Thus player 2 does not have an incentive to deviate.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Finally to check that this is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium we need to check that it is an equilibrium for the whole game as well as all subgames.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We have checked previously that it is an equilibrium for the entire game.</li>
<li>It is also subgame perfect as the profile dictates a stage Nash profile in the last stage.</li>
</ul>
