<h1 id="or-3-chapter-9---finitely-repeated-games">OR 3: Chapter 9 - Finitely Repeated Games</h1>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>In the <a href="Chapter_08-Subgame_Perfection.html">previous chapter</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We looked at the connection between games in normal form and extensive form;</li>
<li>We defined a subgame;</li>
<li>We define a refinement of Nash equilibrium: subgame perfect equilibrium.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter we'll start looking at instances where games are repeated.</p>
<h2 id="definition-of-a-repeated-game">Definition of a repeated game</h2>
<p>In game theory the term <strong>repeated game</strong> is well defined.</p>
<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<hr />
<p>A repeated game is played over discrete time periods. Each time period is index by \(0&lt;t\leq T\) where \(T\) is the total number of periods.</p>
<p>In each period \(n\) players play a static game referred to as the <strong>stage game</strong> independently and simultaneously selecting actions. Each stage game can be denoted by \(\{A,u\}\) where:</p>
<p>\[A=A_1 \times A_2 \times \dots \times A_n\]</p>
<p>and \(u\) denotes the set of utility functions.</p>
<p>Players make decisions in full knowledge of the <strong>history</strong> of the game played so far (ie the actions chosen by each player in each previous time period).</p>
<p>The payoff is defined as the sum of the utilities in each stage game for every time period.</p>
<hr />
<p>As an example let us use the Prisoner's dilemma as the stage game (so we are assuming that we have 2 players playing repeatedly):</p>
<p>\[
\begin{pmatrix}
(2,2)&amp;(0,3)\\
(3,0)&amp;(1,1)
\end{pmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>The following shows all possible outcomes to the repeated game given \(T=2\):</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>When we discuss strategies in repeated games we need to be careful.</p>
<h3 id="definition-1">Definition</h3>
<hr />
<p>A repeated game strategy must specify the action of a player in a given stage game given the entire history of the repeated game.</p>
<hr />
<p>For example in the repeated prisoner's dilemma the following is a valid strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Start to cooperate and in every stage game simply repeat the action used by your opponent in the previous stage game.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus if both players play this strategy both players will cooperate throughout getting (in the case of \(T=2\)) a utility of 4.</p>
<h2 id="subgame-perfect-nash-equilibrium-in-repeated-games">Subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in repeated games</h2>
<h3 id="theorem">Theorem</h3>
<hr />
<p>For any repeated game, any sequence of stage Nash profiles gives the outcome of a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.</p>
<hr />
<p>If we consider the strategy given by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Player \(i\) should play strategy \(\tilde s^{(k)}_i\) regardless of the play of any previous strategy profiles.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where \(\tilde s^{(k)}_i\) is the strategy played by player \(i\) in any stage Nash profile. The \(k\) is used to indicate that all players play strategies from the same stage Nash profile.</p>
<p>Using backwards induction we see that this strategy is a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore it is a stage Nash profile so it is a Nash equilibria for the last stage game which is the last subgame. If we consider (in an inductive way) each subsequent subgame the result holds.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Consider the following stage game:</p>
<p>\[\begin{pmatrix}
(2,3)&amp;(0,2)&amp;(1,4)\\
(0,1)&amp;(1,2)&amp;(0,0)\\
\end{pmatrix}\]</p>
<p>The following plot shows the various possible outcomes of the repeated game for \(T=2\):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="plots/L09-plot02.png" /><p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<p>If we consider the two pure equilibria \((r_1,s_3)\) and \((r_2,s_2)\), we have 4 possible outcomes that correspond to the outcome of a subgame perfect Nash equilibria:</p>
<p>\[(r_1r_1,s_3s_3)\text{ giving utility vector: }(2,8)\] \[(r_1r_2,s_3s_2)\text{ giving utility vector: }(2,6)\] \[(r_2r_1,s_2s_3)\text{ giving utility vector: }(2,6)\] \[(r_2r_2,s_2s_2)\text{ giving utility vector: }(2,4)\]</p>
<p>Importantly, not all subgame Nash equilibria outcomes are of the above form.</p>
<h2 id="reputation-in-repeated-games">Reputation in repeated games</h2>
<p>By definition all subgame Nash equilibria <strong>must</strong> play a stage Nash profilein the last stage game. However can a strategy be found that does not play a Nash profile in earlier games?</p>
<p>Considering the above game, let us look at this strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Play \((r_1,s_1)\) in the first period and then, as long as P2 cooperates play \((r_2,s_3)\) in the second period. If P2 deviates from \(s_1\) in the first period then play \((r_2,s_2)\) in the second period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly this strategy gives the utility vector: \((3,8)\).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is this strategy profile a Nash equilibrium (for the entire game)?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Does player 1 have an incentive to deviate?</li>
</ul>
<p>No any other strategy played in any period would give a lower payoff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does player 2 have an incentive to deviate?</li>
</ul>
<p>If player 2 deviates in the first period, he/she can obtain 4 in the first period but will obtain 2 in the second. Thus a first period deviation increases the score by 1 but decreases the score in the second period by 2. Thus player 2 does not have an incentive to deviate.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Finally to check that this is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium we need to check that it is an equilibrium for the whole game as well as all subgames.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We have checked previously that it is an equilibrium for the entire game.</li>
<li>It is also subgame perfect as the profile dictates a stage Nash profile in the last stage.</li>
</ul>
