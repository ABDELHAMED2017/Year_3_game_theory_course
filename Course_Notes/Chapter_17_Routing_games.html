<h2 id="recap"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Recap</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Course_Notes/Chapter_16_Cooperative_games.html">previous chapter</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We defined characteristic function games;</li>
<li>We defined the Shapley value.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter we'll take a look at another type of game that allows us to model congestion.</p>
<h2 id="routing-games"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Routing games</h2>
<p>Game theory can be used to model congestion in a variety of settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Road traffic;</li>
<li>Data traffic;</li>
<li>Patient flow in healthcare;</li>
<li>Strategies in basketball.</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of game used is referred to as a <strong>routing game</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-routing-game"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Definition of a routing game</h3>
<hr />
<p>A <strong>routing game</strong> <span class="math">\((G,r,c)\)</span> is defined on a graph <span class="math">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> with a defined set of sources <span class="math">\(s_i\)</span> and sinks <span class="math">\(t_i\)</span>. Each source-sink pair corresponds to a set of traffic (also called a commodity) <span class="math">\(r_i\)</span> that must travel along the edges of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> from <span class="math">\(s_i\)</span> to <span class="math">\(t_i\)</span>. Every edge <span class="math">\(e\)</span> of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> has associated to it a nonnegative, continuous and nondecreasing cost function (also called latency function) <span class="math">\(c_e\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>An example of such a game is given.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Course_Notes/images/L17-img01.png" />
</div>
<p>In this game we have two <strong>commodoties</strong> with two sources: <span class="math">\(s_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(s_2\)</span> and a single sink <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. To complete our definition of a routing game we require a quantity of traffic, let <span class="math">\(r=(1/2,1/2)\)</span>. We also require a set of cost functions <span class="math">\(c\)</span>. Let:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
c_{s_1a}&amp;=0\\
c_{s_2a}&amp;=0\\
c_{s_1t}&amp;=x^2\\
c_{s_2t}&amp;=\frac{x}{2}x\\
c_{at}&amp;=x\\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We represent all this diagrammatically.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<h3 id="definition-of-the-set-of-paths"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Definition of the set of paths</h3>
<hr />
<p>For any given <span class="math">\((G,r,c)\)</span> we denote by <span class="math">\(\mathcal{P}_i\)</span> the set of paths available to commodity <span class="math">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>For our example we have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathcal{P}_1=\{s_1at,s_1t\}\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathcal{P}_2=\{s_2at,s_2t\}\]</span></p>
<p>We denote the set of all possible paths by <span class="math">\(\mathcal{P}=\bigcup_{i}\mathcal{P}_i\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-feasible-path"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Definition of a feasible path</h3>
<hr />
<p>On a routing game we define a flow <span class="math">\(f\)</span> as a vector representing the quantity of traffic along the various paths, <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a vector index by <span class="math">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>. Furthermore we call <span class="math">\(f\)</span> <strong>feasible</strong> if:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}_i}f_P=r_i\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>In our running example <span class="math">\(f=(1/4,1/4,0,1/2)\)</span> is a feasible flow.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Course_Notes/images/L17-img03.png" />
</div>
<p>To go further we need to try and measure how good a flow is.</p>
<h2 id="optimal-flow"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Optimal flow</h2>
<h3 id="definition-of-the-cost-function"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Definition of the cost function</h3>
<hr />
<p>For any routing game <span class="math">\((G,r,c)\)</span> we define a <strong>cost function</strong> <span class="math">\(C(f)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[C(f)=\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}}c_P(f_P)f_P\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Where <span class="math">\(c_P\)</span> denotes the cost function of a particular path <span class="math">\(P\)</span>: <span class="math">\(c_P(x)=\sum_{e\in P}c_e(x)\)</span>. Note that any flow <span class="math">\(f\)</span> induces a flow on edges:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[f_e=\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}\text{ if }e\in P}f_P\]</span></p>
<p>So we can re-write the cost function as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[C(f)=\sum_{e\in E}c_e(f_e)f_e\]</span></p>
<p>Thus for our running example if we take a general <span class="math">\(f=(\alpha,1/2-\alpha,1/2-\beta,\beta)\)</span> as shown.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Course_Notes/images/L17-img04.png" />
</div>
<p>The cost of <span class="math">\(f(\alpha,1/2-\alpha,1/2-\beta,\beta)\)</span> is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
C(f)&amp;=\alpha^2\times\alpha+3/2\beta\times\beta+(1-\alpha-\beta)\times(1-\alpha-\beta)\\
    &amp;=\alpha^3+3/2\beta^2+\alpha^2 + 2\alpha\beta + \beta^2 - 2\alpha - 2\beta + 1
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="definition-of-an-optimal-flow"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Definition of an optimal flow</h3>
<hr />
<p>For a routing game <span class="math">\((G,r,c)\)</span> we define the optimal flow <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span> as the solution to the following optimisation problem:</p>
<p>Minimise <span class="math">\(\sum_{e\in E}c_e(f_e)\)</span>:</p>
<p>Subject to:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}_i}f_P&amp;=r_i&amp;&amp;\text{for all }i\\
f_e&amp;=\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}\text{ if }e\in P}f_P&amp;&amp;\text{ for all }e\in E\\
f_P&amp;\geq 0
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>In our example this corresponds to minimising <span class="math">\(C(\alpha,\beta)=\alpha^3+3/2\beta^2+\alpha^2 + 2\alpha\beta + \beta^2 - 2\alpha - 2\beta + 1\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(0\leq\alpha\leq 1/2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(0\leq\beta\leq1/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>A plot of <span class="math">\(C(\alpha,\beta)\)</span> is shown.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Course_Notes/plots/L17-plot01.png" />
</div>
<p>It looks like the minimal point is somewhere near higher values of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>. Let us carry out our optimisation properly:</p>
<p>If define the Lagrangian:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[L(\alpha,\beta,\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3,\lambda_4)=C(\alpha,\beta)-\lambda_1\alpha-\lambda_2(\alpha-1/2)-\lambda_3\beta-\lambda_4\beta\]</span></p>
<p>This will work but creates a large number of variables (so things will get messy quickly). Instead let us realise that the minima will either be in the interior of our region or on the boundary of our region.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is on the interior of the region then we will have:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac{\partial C}{\partial \alpha}=3\alpha^2-2(1-\alpha-\beta)=0\]</span> and <span class="math">\[\frac{\partial C}{\partial \beta}=3\beta-2(1-\alpha-\beta)=0\]</span></p>
<p>which gives:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\beta=\frac{2(1-\alpha)}{5}\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting this in to the first equation gives:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[3\alpha^2-\frac{6}{5}(1-\alpha)=0\]</span></p>
<p>which has solution (in our region):</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\alpha_1=\frac{\sqrt{11}-1}{5}\approx 0.4633\]</span> giving: <span class="math">\[\beta_1=0.2147\]</span></p>
<p>Firstly <span class="math">\((\alpha_1,\beta_1)\)</span> is located in the required region. Secondly it is straightforward to verify that this is a local minima (by checking the second derivatives).</p>
<p>We have <span class="math">\(C(\alpha_1,\beta_1)=\frac{3}{125} \left(\sqrt{11} - 6\right)^{2} + \frac{1}{125}\left(\sqrt{11} - 1\right)^{3}\approx .2723\)</span>.</p>
<p>To verify that this is an optimal flow we need to verify that it is less than all values on the boundaries. We first calculate the values on the extremal points of our boundary:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(C(0,0)=1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(C(0,1/2)=5/8=.625\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(C(1/2,0)=3/8=.375\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(C(1/2,1/2)=1/2=.5\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We now check that there are no local optima on the boundary:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Consider <span class="math">\(C(\alpha,0)=\alpha^3+\alpha^2-2\alpha+1\)</span> equating the derivative to 0 gives: <span class="math">\(3\alpha^2+2\alpha-2=0\)</span> which has solution <span class="math">\(\alpha=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{7}}{3}\)</span>. We have <span class="math">\(C(\frac{-1+\sqrt{7}}{3},0)\approx.3689\)</span>.</li>
<li>Consider <span class="math">\(C(\alpha,1/2)=\alpha^3+\alpha^2-\alpha+5/8\)</span> equating the derivative to 0 gives: <span class="math">\(3\alpha^2+2\alpha-a+5/8=0\)</span> which has solution <span class="math">\(\alpha=1/3\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\alpha=1\)</span>. We have <span class="math">\(C(1/3,1/2)\approx.4398\)</span></li>
<li>When considering <span class="math">\(C(0,\beta)\)</span> we know that the local optima is at <span class="math">\(\beta=\frac{2}{5}\)</span>. We have <span class="math">\(C(0,2/5)=.6\)</span>.</li>
<li>Similarly when considering <span class="math">\(C(1/2,\beta)\)</span> we know that the local optima is at <span class="math">\(\beta=\frac{2-1/2}{5}\)</span>. We have <span class="math">\(C(1/2,3/10)=.3\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus <span class="math">\(f^*\approx(.4633,0.2147)\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="nash-flows"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Nash flows</h2>
<p>If we take a closer look at <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span> in our example, we see that traffic from the first commodity travels across two paths: <span class="math">\(P_1=s_1t\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P_2=s_1at\)</span>. The cost along the first path is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[C_{P_1}(f^*)=.4633^2\approx.2146\]</span></p>
<p>The cost along the second path is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[C_{P_2}(f^*)=(1-.4633-.2147)\approx .3220\]</span></p>
<p>Thus traffic going along the second path is experiencing a higher cost. If this flow represented commuters on their way to work in the morning users of the second path would deviate to use the first. This leads to the definition of a Nash flow.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-nash-flow"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Definition of a Nash flow</h3>
<hr />
<p>For a routing game <span class="math">\((G,r,c)\)</span> a flow <span class="math">\(\tilde f\)</span> is called a <strong>Nash flow</strong> if and only if for every commodity <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and any two paths <span class="math">\(P_1,P_2\in\mathcal{P}_i\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(f_{P_1}&gt;0\)</span> then:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[c_{P_1}(f)\leq c_{P_2}(f)\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>In other words a Nash flow ensures that all used paths have minimal costs.</p>
<p>If we consider our example and assume that both commodities use all paths available to them:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\alpha^2&amp;=1-\alpha-\beta\\
\frac{3\beta}{2}&amp;=1-\alpha-\beta
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Solving this gives: <span class="math">\(\beta=\frac{2}{5}(1-\alpha)\)</span> <span class="math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math">\(x^{2} + \frac{3}{5} \, x - \frac{3}{5}\)</span> this gives <span class="math">\(\alpha\approx .5307\)</span> which is not in our region. Let us assume that <span class="math">\(\alpha=1/2\)</span> (i.e. commodity 1 does not use <span class="math">\(P_2\)</span>). Assuming that the second commodity uses both available paths we have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac{3}{2}\beta=\frac{1}{2}-\beta\Rightarrow\beta=\frac{1}{5}\]</span></p>
<p>We can check that all paths have minimal cost.</p>
<p>Thus we have <span class="math">\(\tilde f=(1/2,1/5)\)</span> which gives a cost of <span class="math">\(C(\tilde f)=11/40\)</span> (higher than the optimal cost!).</p>
<p>What if we had assumed that <span class="math">\(\beta=1/2\)</span>?</p>
<p>This would have given <span class="math">\(\alpha^2=1/2-\alpha\)</span> which has solution <span class="math">\(\alpha\approx .3660\)</span>. The cost of the path <span class="math">\(s_2at\)</span> is then <span class="math">\(.134\)</span> however the cost of the path <span class="math">\(s_2t\)</span> is <span class="math">\(.75\)</span> thus the second commodity should deviate. We can carry out these same checks with all other possibilities to verify that <span class="math">\(\tilde f=(1/2,1/5)\)</span>.</p>
