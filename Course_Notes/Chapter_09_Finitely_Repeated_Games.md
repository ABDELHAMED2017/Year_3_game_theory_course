# OR 3: Chapter 9 - Finitely Repeated Games

## Recap

In the [previous chapter](Chapter_08-Subgame_Perfection.html):

- We looked at the connection between games in normal form and extensive form;
- We defined a subgame;
- We define a refinement of Nash equilibrium: subgame perfect equilibrium.

In this chapter we'll start looking at instances where games are repeated.
