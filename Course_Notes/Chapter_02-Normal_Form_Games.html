<h2 id="recap"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Recap</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Course_Notes/Chapter_01-Introduction.html">previous lecture</a> we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive decision making;</li>
<li>Normal form games;</li>
<li>Normal form games and representing information sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We did this looking at a game called &quot;the battle of the sexes&quot;:</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Can we think of a better way of representing this game?</p>
<h2 id="normal-form-games"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Normal form games</h2>
<p>Another representation for a game is called the <strong>normal form</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-normal-form-game"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Definition of a normal form game</h3>
<hr />
<p>A <span class="math">\(N\)</span> player <strong>normal form game</strong> consists of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A finite set of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> players;</li>
<li>Strategy spaces for the players: <span class="math">\(S_1, S_2, S_3, \dots S_N\)</span>;</li>
<li>Payoff functions for the players: <span class="math">\(u_i:S_{1}\times S_2\dots\times S_N\to \mathbb{R}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The convention used in this course (unless otherwise stated) is that all players aim to choose from their strategies in such a way as to maximise their utilities.</p>
<p>A natural way of representing a two player normal form game is using a <strong>bi-matrix</strong>. If we assume that <span class="math">\(N=2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S_1=\{r_i\;|\;1\leq i\leq m \}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S_2=\{s_j\;|\;1\leq j\leq n \}\)</span> then a <strong>bi-matrix</strong> representation of the game considered is shown .</p>

If the dominant pig pushes the lever, the subservient pig has some time to eat most of the food before being pushed out of the way. If the subservient pig push the lever, the dominant pig will eat all the food. Finally if both pigs go to push the lever the subservient pig will be able to eat a third of the food.</p>

<h2 id="mixed-strategies"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Mixed Strategies</h2>
<p>So far we have only considered so called <strong>pure strategies</strong>. We will now allow players to play <strong>mixed strategies</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-mixed-strategy"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Definition of a mixed strategy</h3>
<hr />
<p>In an <span class="math">\(N\)</span> player normal form game a <strong>mixed strategy</strong> for player <span class="math">\(i\)</span> denoted by <span class="math">\(\sigma_i\in[0,1]^{|S_i|}_{\mathbb{R}}\)</span> is a probability distribution over the pure strategies of player <span class="math">\(i\)</span>. So:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_{i=1}^{|S_i|}\sigma_i=1\]</span></p>
<p>For a given player <span class="math">\(i\)</span> we denote the set of mixed strategies as <span class="math">\(\Delta S_i\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>For example in the matching pennies game discussed previously. A strategy profile of <span class="math">\(\sigma_1=(.2,.8)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma_2=(.6,.4)\)</span> implies that player 1 plays heads with probability .2 and player 2 plays heads with probability .6.</p>
<p>We can extend the utility function which maps from the set of pure strategies to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> using <em>expected payoffs</em>. For a two player game we have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u_{i}(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)=\sum_{r\in S_1,s\in S_2}\sigma_1(r)\sigma_2(s)u_{i}(r,s)\]</span></p>
<p>(where we relax our notation to allow <span class="math">\(\sigma_i:S_i\to[0,1]_{\mathbb{R}}\)</span> so that <span class="math">\(\sigma_i(s_i)\)</span> denotes the probability of playing <span class="math">\(s_i\in S_i\)</span>.)</p>
<h2 id="matching-pennies-revisited."><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Matching pennies revisited.</h2>
<p>In the previously discussed strategy profile of <span class="math">\(\sigma_1=(.2,.8)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma_2=(.6,.4)\)</span> the expected utilities can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u_{1}(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)=\sum_{r\in S_1,s\in S_2}\sigma_1(r)\sigma_2(s)u_{1}(r,s)=.2\times.6\times 1+.2\times.4\times (-1)+.8\times .6\times (-1) + .8\times .4\times 1=-.12\]</span> <span class="math">\[u_{2}(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)=\sum_{r\in S_1,s\in S_2}\sigma_1(r)\sigma_2(s)u_{2}(r,s)=.2\times.6\times (-1)+.2\times.4\times 1+.8\times .6\times 1 + .8\times .4\times (-1)=.12\]</span></p>
<h3 id="example"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Example</h3>
<hr />
<p>If we assume that player 2 always plays tails, what is the expected utility to player 1?</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\sigma_1=(x,1-x)\)</span> and we have <span class="math">\(\sigma_2=(0,1)\)</span> which gives:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u_{1}(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)=\sum_{r\in S_1,s\in S_2}\sigma_1(r)\sigma_2(s)u_{1}(r,s)=-x+(1-x)=1-2x\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly if player 1 always plays tails the expected utility to player 2 is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u_{2}(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)=\sum_{r\in S_1,s\in S_2}\sigma_1(r)\sigma_2(s)u_{2}(r,s)=x+(x-1)=2x-1\]</span></p>
<p>A plot of this is shown .</p>

<p>Add to this plot by assuming that the players independently both play heads.</p>
