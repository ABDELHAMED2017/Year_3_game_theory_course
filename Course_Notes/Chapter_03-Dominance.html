<h1 id="or-3-chapter-3---dominance"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> OR 3: Chapter 3 - Dominance</h1>
<h2 id="recap"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Recap</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://drvinceknight.github.io/Year_3_game_theory_course/Course_Notes/Chapter_02-Normal_Form_Games.html">previous lecture</a> we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal form games;</li>
<li>Mixed strategies and expected utilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We spent some time talking about predicting rational behaviour in the above games but we will now look a particular tool in a formal way.</p>
<h2 id="dominant-strategies"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Dominant strategies</h2>
<p>In certain games it is evident that certain strategies should never be used by a rational player. To formalise this we need a couple of definitions.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-an-incomplete-strategy-profile"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Definition of an incomplete strategy profile</h3>
<hr />
<p>In an <span class="math">\(N\)</span> player normal form game when considering player <span class="math">\(i\)</span> we denotes by <span class="math">\(s_{-i}\)</span> an <strong>incomplete strategy</strong> profile for all other players in the game.</p>
<hr />
<p>For example in a 3 player game where <span class="math">\(S_i=\{A,B\}\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(i\)</span> a valid strategy profile is <span class="math">\(s=(A,A,B)\)</span> while <span class="math">\(s_{-2}=(A,B)\)</span> denotes the incomplete strategy profile where player 1 and 3 are playing A and B (respectively).</p>
<p>This notation now allows us to define an important notion in game theory.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-strictly-dominated-strategy"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Definition of a strictly dominated strategy</h3>
<hr />
<p>In an <span class="math">\(N\)</span> player normal form game. A pure strategy <span class="math">\(s_i\in S_i\)</span> is said to be <strong>strictly dominated</strong> if there is a strategy <span class="math">\(\sigma_i\in \Delta S_i\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(u_i(\sigma_i,s_{-i})&gt;u_{i}(s_i,s_{-i})\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(s_{-i}\in S_{-i}\)</span> of the other players.</p>
<hr />
<p>When attempting to predict rational behaviour we can elimate dominated strategies.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(0,1)&amp;(3,5)\\
(5,10)&amp;(-1,34)
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>If we let <span class="math">\(S_1=\{r_1, r_2\}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S_2=\{s_1, s_2\}\)</span> we see that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[u_2(s_2,r_1)&gt;u_2(s_1,r_1)\]</span> and <span class="math">\[u_2(s_2,r_2)&gt;u_2(s_1,r_2)\]</span></p>
<p>so <span class="math">\(s_1\)</span> is a strictly dominated strategy for player 2. As such we can elimante it from the game when attempting to predict rational behaviour. This gives the following game:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(3,5)\\
(-1,34)
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>At this point it is straightforward to see that <span class="math">\(r_2\)</span> is a strictly dominated strategy for player 1 giving the following predicted strategy profile: <span class="math">\(s=(r_1,s_2)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-weakly-dominated-strategy"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Definition of a weakly dominated strategy</h3>
<hr />
<p>In an <span class="math">\(N\)</span> player normal form game. A pure strategy <span class="math">\(s_i\in S_i\)</span> is said to be <strong>weakly dominated</strong> if there is a strategy <span class="math">\(\sigma_i\in \Delta S_i\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(u_i(\sigma_i,s_{-i})\geq u_{i}(s_i,s_{-i})\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(s_{-i}\in S_{-i}\)</span> of the other players and there exists a strategy profile <span class="math">\(\bar s\in S_{-i}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(u_i(\sigma_i,\bar s)&gt; u_{i}(s_i,s_{-i})\)</span> .</p>
<hr />
<p>We can once again predict rational behaviour by eliminating weakly dominated strategies.</p>
<p>As an example consider the following two player game:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(3,3)&amp;(2,2)\\
(2,1)&amp;(2,1)
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the same convention as before for player 2, <span class="math">\(s_1\)</span> weakly dominates <span class="math">\(s_2\)</span> and for player 1, <span class="math">\(r_1\)</span> weakly dominates <span class="math">\(r_2\)</span> giving the following predicted strategy profile <span class="math">\((r_1,s_1)\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="common-knowledge-of-rationality"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Common knowledge of rationality</h2>
<p>An important aspect of game theory and the tool that we have in fact been using so far is to assume that players are rational. However we can (and need) to go further:</p>
<ul>
<li>The players are rational;</li>
<li>The players all know that the other players are rational;</li>
<li>The players all know that the other players know that they are rationals;</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>This chain of assumptions is called <strong>Common knowledge of rationality</strong> (CKR). By applying the CKR assumption we can attempt to predict rational behaviour through the iterated elimination of dominated strategies (as we have been doing above).</p>
<h3 id="example"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Example</h3>
<p>Let us try to predict rational behaviour in the following game using iterated elimination of dominated strategies:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(1,0)&amp;(1,2)&amp;(0,1)\\
(0,3)&amp;(0,1)&amp;(2,0)
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Initially</strong> player 1 has no dominated strategies. For player 2, <span class="math">\(s_3\)</span> is dominated by <span class="math">\(s_2\)</span>. Now <span class="math">\(r_2\)</span> is dominated by <span class="math">\(r_1\)</span> for player 1. Finally, <span class="math">\(s_1\)</span> is dominated by <span class="math">\(s_2\)</span>. Thus <span class="math">\((r_1,s_2)\)</span> is a predicted rational outcome.</p>
<h3 id="example-1"><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Example</h3>
<p>Let us try to predict rational behaviour in the following game using iterated elimination of dominated strategies:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(10,1)&amp;(5,1)&amp;(1,-2)\\
(10,1)&amp;(5,0)&amp;(4,2)
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(r_1\)</span> weakly dominated by <span class="math">\(r_2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(s_1\)</span> strictly dominated by <span class="math">\(s_3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(s_2\)</span> strictly dominated by <span class="math">\(s_1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus <span class="math">\((r_2,s_3)\)</span> is a predicted rational outcome.</p>
<h2 id="not-all-games-can-be-solved-using-dominance"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Not all games can be solved using dominance</h2>
<p>Consider the following two games:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(3,2)&amp;(0,0)\\
(1,1)&amp;(2,3)
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(1,3)&amp;(4,2)&amp;(2,2)\\
(4,0)&amp;(0,3)&amp;(4,1)\\
(2,5)&amp;(3,4)&amp;(5,6)
\end{pmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>Why can't we predict rational behaviour using dominance?</p>
