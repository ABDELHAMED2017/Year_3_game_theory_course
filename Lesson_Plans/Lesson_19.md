# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 19
## Routing games 2

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Describe equivalence between Nash and optimal flow

### Timeline

#### Before the lecture

NA

#### During the lecture

Discuss connection to previous game, use same example

****
Find Nash by optimising:
****

phi(alpha_0, alpha_1, alpha_2) = alpha_0 ^2 / 2 + 2 alpha_1 + (alpha_0 + alpha_1) ^ 3 / 3  + 3(4-alpha_0 - alpha_1)

minimise such that 0 <= alpha_0 + alpha_1 <= 4 and alpha_0, alpha_1 >= 0

Get same result.

****
Find optimal by Nash
****

Marginal cost: c* = dxc/dx = c + xc'

Draw game with these costs.

So Nash is now given by:

3alpha_0^2+2alpha_0 = 0

alpha_0 = sqrt(10)/3 - 1/3

P0 and P2 have latency: 3
P1: 2 + 3(sqrt(10)/3-1/3)^2 approx 3.55.

#### After the lecture

Students given reading and exercises.

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking student to sketch proofs of results and use them to solve games.
