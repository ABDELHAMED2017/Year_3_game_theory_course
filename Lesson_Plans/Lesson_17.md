# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 17
## Cooperative games

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be able to:

- Define a cooperative game;
- Calculate the shapley value for a game.

### Timeline

#### Before the lecture

- Invite students to look at video on Shapley value.

#### During the lecture

Ask for 3 volunteers (possibly two with me joining in).
Explain that team will need to work together to shoot baskets.
Class will need to evaluate how well everyone does.

1 minute timer: get 3 to shoot hoops!

Discuss with class to come up with characteristic function game.

Now: how should we share out chocolates?

Show Gale Shapley valu:

- For each permutation write down the predecessors;
- Write down the corresponding marginal contributions (get the table)
- Calculate the G-S value

Show how to do this in Sage.

#### After the lecture

Students will be given reading and exercises.

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking student to define cooperative games and calculate the shapley value for a game.
