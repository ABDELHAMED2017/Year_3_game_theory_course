# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 18
## Routing games 1

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Define a routing game;
- Define optimal flow for a game;
- Define Nash flow for a game.

### Timeline

#### Before the lecture

    - VK: Conclusions

#### After the lecture

Students given reading and exercises.

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking students to define non-atomic routing games and solve from basic principles the Nash flow and optimal flow.
