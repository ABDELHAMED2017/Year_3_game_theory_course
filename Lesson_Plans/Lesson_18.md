# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 18
## Routing games 1

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Define a routing game;
- Define optimal flow for a game;
- Define Nash flow for a game.

### Timeline

#### Before the lecture

- Invite students to view video on Pigou's example.
- Ask students to play a very simple routing game online.

#### During the lecture

Look at Pigou's example

Ask class to put hand up and choose which way they are going.

Go through more complex example (write this up here).

#### After the lecture

Students given reading and exercises.

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking students to define non-atomic routing games and solve from basic principles the Nash flow and optimal flow.
