# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 16
## Matching games

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Define a matching games
- Solve a matching game using the Gayle Shapley algorithm

### Timeline

#### Before the lecture

- Invite students to watch video on matching game.

#### During the lecture

Bring 3 toys to class:

- Donatello
- Remote controlled helicopter? [If it charges?]
- Football

Find 3 students and ask them to write down their preferences 'who would you like to have with you for the 2 hours?'.

Say that the toys have preferences: come up with them.
Ask class how we should match things?

Proceed to show stability problems of suggested matchings.
Let students go back and have toys.

Discuss how this changes etc...

Proceed to theory:
    - Definitions
    - Discuss the algorithm
    - Discuss theorems and proofs

Show how to do this in Sage.

#### After the lecture

Students given homework sheet 4 (Repeated games and Evolutionary game theory).

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking student to solve matching games as well as comment on some applications.
