1. Results from matching pennies game
2. 2 Volunteers to play sequence of 4 games:

    - [[[1,-1],[-1,1]],[[-1,1],[1,-1]]]
    - [[[1,-1],[-1,1]],[[1,-1],[1,-1]]]
    - [[[2,-2],[-1,1]],[[-1,1],[2,-2]]]
    - [[[2,-2],[1,-1]],[[-1,1],[2,-2]]]

    Score corresponds to number of chocolates they get as a twosome.

3. Then both players play:

    - [[[1,1],[0,1.5]],[[1.5,0],[.5,.5]]]

    This score corresponds to sharing of chocolates.

    Purpose of above is to familiarise dominated strategies
