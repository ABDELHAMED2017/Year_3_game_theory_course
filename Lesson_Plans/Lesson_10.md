# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 10
## Finitely repeated games

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Describe infinetely repeated games
- Obtain equilibria of repeated games

### Timeline

#### Before the lecture

- Students will have read the results from the prisoners dilemma tournament

#### During the lecture

- Discuss definition of repeated games
- Define strategies (in that they can depend on history)
- Theorem about repetition of stage NE being subgame perfect equilibrium
- Show that other subgame perfect NE exist. Use following game as an example:

[0,0],[3,3],[1,1]
[1,1],[7,0],[5,1]

Two stage Nash:

(r2,s1) and (r2,s3)

P1 wants to end in (r2,s3), P2 can offer (r1, s2) in first round.

NE:

'Play (r1,s2) in first round and (r1,s3) in second round unless P2 does not cooperate in which case play (r2, s1)'

Outcome: (8,4).

Deviate:
    P1: If deviate in 1st round get (8,0): no reason to deviate.
    P2: No incentive to move in first round.

NE for whole game and first real subgame: also NE as end in stage Nash.

#### After the lecture

Students given homework sheet 3 (More normal form equilibria, backward induction, subgame equilibria).

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking student to analyse repeated games as well as discuss Axelrod's work.
