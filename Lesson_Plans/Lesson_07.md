# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 7
## Extensive form games and backwards induction

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Describe properties of a game tree;
- Describe sequential rationality and backward induction;
- Use the above to identify equilibrium.

### Timeline

#### Before the lecture

- Invite students to play some online games (with variable amounts)

#### During the lecture

- Give definition of an extensive form game, use following as an example:

- Root: Jason
    - Red -> Vince:
        - Green (4,4)
        - Orange (2,3)
    - Blue -> Vince
        - Green (3,2)
        - Orange (1,1)

- Go through notes.

- Do effort of teacher/student extensive form game:

    - Difficulty of exam: K
    - Effort of teacher: e_t
    - Effort of students: e_s

    Mark is then: m = e_s+e_t-K

    Utilities are: (me_t+e_s^2, me_s-e_t^2)

    ... (a lot of work)

    If student picks effort first the equilibria is (1,1/2).
    If teacher picks effort first, the equilibria is (1, (1-K)/2)).
    This implies that teacher might as well make the exam difficulty: K=0.

    Change utility to (me_t-e_s^2, me_s-e_t^2).
    Get equilibria: (0,0) (same by symmetry if swap).

#### After the lecture

Students given homework sheet 2 (obtaining normal form game equilibria).

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking student to solve and represent a series of games.
