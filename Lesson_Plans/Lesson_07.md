# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 8
## Extensive form games and backwards induction

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Describe properties of a game tree;
- Make connections between normal form games and extensive form games;
- Describe sequential rationality and backward induction;
- Use the above to identify equilibrium.
