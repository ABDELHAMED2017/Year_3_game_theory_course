# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 7
## Mixed strategy Nash Equilibria

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Define mixed strategy Nash equilibria;
- Obtain Nash equilibria in pure strategy.

### Timeline

- Play a R,P,S,L,S round robin (need 16 volunteers)

- Recall results from play against random strategies

- Calculate NE using best responses for


    [[2, -2], [-2, 2]]
    [[-1, 1], [1, -1]]

- Theorem for NE

- Calculate same example using theorem

- Nash's theorem

#### Before the lecture

- Invite students to watch [this video](http://youtu.be/poYucyX7-gE).
- Invite students to play random 1 shot games online.

#### During the lecture


#### After the lecture

Students will be given reading and some practice exercises.

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking student to define NE, prove the equality of payoffs theorem and compute NE using theorem and best responses.
