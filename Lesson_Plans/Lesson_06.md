# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 7
## Mixed strategy Nash Equilibria

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Define mixed strategy Nash equilibria;
- Obtain Nash equilibria in pure strategy.

### Timeline

#### After the lecture

Students will be given reading and some practice exercises as well as a document about connection between linear programming and zero sum games (possibly create video?).

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking student to define NE, prove the equality of payoffs theorem and compute NE using theorem and best responses.
