# OR 3: Lesson Plan Lecture 5
## Nash equilibria in pure equilibria

### Aims of lecture

At the end of this lecture students will be to:

- Define Nash equilibria in terms of best responses;
- Solve Game having a pure strategy Nash Equilibria.

### Timeline

#### Before the lecture

- NA

#### During the lecture

- Clarify when cannot get predicted rational behaviour:

    - Not enough dominated strategies
    - No pair of best responses

- Give example corresponding two students working on a group project:

    S1 = {x in R| 0 \leq x \leq 1}
    S2 = {y in R| 0 \leq y \leq 1}

    Their strategies represents their efforts on a group project.
    Their utility is a combination of their mark and effort:

    u1 = (x+y)y-1/2x^2
    u2 = (x+y)x-1/2y^2

    ... Equilibria is to have same effort.

#### After the lecture

Students will be given reading and some practice exercises.

### Assessment

Assessment of the content covered in this lecture will be through examination questions asking student to define Nash equilibria and also solve games.
