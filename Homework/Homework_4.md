# Homework sheet 4 - Evolutionary games, games with incomplete information and stochastic games


1. Consider the pairwise contest games with the following associated two player games:

    $$\begin{pmatrix}
    (2,2)&(4,5)\\
    (5,4)&(1,1)\\
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    $$\begin{pmatrix}
    (1,1)&(0,0)\\
    (0,0)&(1,1)
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    $$\begin{pmatrix}
    (\alpha,\alpha)&(1,\beta)\\
    (\beta,1)&(0,0)\\
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    (Assume $\alpha,\beta >0$ and $\alpha \ne \beta$)

    Identify all evolutionary stable strategies.


2. Consider the following game:

    > In a mathematics department, researchers can choose to use one of two systems for typesetting their research papers: LaTeX or Word. We will refer to these two strategies as $L$ and $W$ respectively. A user of $W$ receives a basic utility of 1 and as $L$ is more widely used by mathematicians out of the department and is in general considered to be a better system a user of $L$ gets a basic utility of $\alpha > 1$. Members of the mathematics department often collaborate and as such it is beneficial for the researchers to use the same typesetting system. If we let $\mu$ represent the proportion of users of $L$ we let:

    $$u(L,\chi)=\alpha+2\mu$$
    $$u(W,\chi)=1+2(1-\mu)$$

    What are the evolutionary stable strategies?

3. Consider the following two normal form games:

    $$A=\begin{pmatrix}
    (3,0)&(-1,-1)&(1,2)\\
    (1,0)&(-1,1)&(2,0)\\
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    $$B=\begin{pmatrix}
    (2,2)&(1,1)&(1,3)\\
    (1,3)&(-2,-3)&(4,2)\\
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    Assume both players play either game $A$ or game $B$ with probability $1/2$, neither player knows which game is played. Obtain the Nash equilibrium for this game.

4. Repeat the analysis of the principal agent game assuming that $p$ is the probability of the project being successful in case of a high level of effort by the employee.

    i. What are the expected utilities to the employer and the employee?
    ii. Obtain a condition for which the employer should offer a bonus.

5. Obtain the Markov Nash equilibrium (in pure strategies if it exists) for the following games assuming $\delta=1/4$.
