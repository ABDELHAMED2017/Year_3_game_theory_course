<p>In a mathematics department, researchers can choose to use one of two systems for typesetting their research papers: LaTeX or Word. We will refer to these two strategies as \(L\) and \(W\) respectively. A user of \(W\) receives a basic utility of 1 and as \(L\) is more widely used by mathematicians out of the department and is in general considered to be a better system a user of \(L\) gets a basic utility of \(\alpha\). Members of the mathematics department often collaborate and as such it is beneficial for the researchers to use the same typesetting system. If we let \(\mu\) represent the proportion of users of \(L\) we let:</p>

<li><p>Consider the simple game with two players: an insurer and a driver. The insurer sets a premium price \(K\geq 0\), once that is done the driver can choose to buy insurance or not. It is assumed that the driver will have an accident with probability \(p\), if the driver has an accident the financial cost is \(A\). Represent this game in normal form and obtain the Nash equilibrium for the game as a function of the parameters. Modify your analysis assuming that the utility function to the driver is given by \(u(x)=x^{1/\alpha}\) and the utility to the insurer is given by \(u(x)=x^{1/\beta}\).</p></li>
