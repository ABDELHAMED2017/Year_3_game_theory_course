<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Consider the pairwise contest games with the following associated two player games:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(2,2)&amp;(4,5)\\
(5,4)&amp;(1,1)\\
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{pmatrix}
(1,1)&amp;(0,0)\\
(0,0)&amp;(1,1)
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Identify all evolutionary stable strategies.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the following game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a mathematics department, researchers can choose to use one of two systems for typesetting their research papers: LaTeX or Word. We will refer to these two strategies as <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math">\(W\)</span> respectively. A user of <span class="math">\(W\)</span> receives a basic utility of 1 and as <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is more widely used by mathematicians out of the department and is in general considered to be a better system a user of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> gets a basic utility of <span class="math">\(\alpha &gt; 1\)</span>. Members of the mathematics department often collaborate and as such it is beneficial for the researchers to use the same typesetting system. If we let <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> represent the proportion of users of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> we let:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[u(L,\chi)=\alpha+2\mu\]</span> <span class="math">\[u(W,\chi)=1+2(1-\mu)\]</span></p>
<p>What are the evolutionary stable strategies?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the following two normal form games:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[A=\begin{pmatrix}
(3,0)&amp;(-1,-1)&amp;(1,2)\\
(1,0)&amp;(-1,1)&amp;(2,0)\\
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[B=\begin{pmatrix}
(2,2)&amp;(1,1)&amp;(1,3)\\
(1,3)&amp;(-2,-3)&amp;(4,2)\\
\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Assume both players play either game <span class="math">\(A\)</span> or game <span class="math">\(B\)</span> with probability <span class="math">\(1/2\)</span>, neither player knows which game is played. Obtain the Nash equilibrium for this game.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the analysis of the principal agent game assuming that <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is the probability of the project being successful in case of a high level of effort by the employee.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>What are the expected utilities to the employer and the employee?</li>
<li>Obtain a condition for which the employer should offer a bonus.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Obtain the Markov Nash equilibrium (in pure strategies if it exists) for the following games assuming <span class="math">\(\delta=1/4\)</span>.</p>
