[The 2015-2016 exam can be found here]({{site.baseurl}}/Exam/2015-2016.pdf)

1.  This question covers basic aspects of Normal form games which have
    been covered many times in class. Whilst the solutions might make it
    appear to be a long question I would consider it to be the easiest
    of the Game Theoretic questions with routine concepts.

2. This is an entirely book work question.

3. A mixture of bookwork and application of an algorithm seen in class.
