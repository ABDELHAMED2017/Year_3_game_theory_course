For the external examiner we are required to put together a commentary
for each exam. Here is the commentary I would have put together for this
exam.

1.  This question covers basic aspects of Normal form games which have
    been covered many times in class. Whilst the solutions might make it
    appear to be a long question I would consider it to be the easiest
    of the Game Theoretic questions with routine concepts.\<

    1.  Bookwork;

    2.  This question should be relatively straightforward asking the
        students to identify best responses to pure strategies;

    3.  This question asks students to plot the utilities, it requires
        the knowledge of mixed strategies with an ability to plot a
        line;

    4.  Repetition of previous question;

    5.  This questions requires a bit of work asking the students to
        consider the plots drawn previously to obtain best responses to
        the mixed strategies;

    6.  This uses the previous question;

    7.  Above used best responses, now I am asking the students to state
        and prove a theorem (the proof is 4 lines of algebra and is
        bookwork). After stating the theorem the students are expected
        to apply it to the above problem.

2.  This question considers repeated games.

    1.  A classic game that requires some thought from the student. I
        expect students to be able to obtain 6 marks with no difficulty
        whatsoever.

    2.  Bookwork;

    3.  Slightly tricky question as it requires students to not only be
        aware of techniques required but must also be confident in their
        knowledge of what a valid game is.

3.  This question is a mix of bookwork and a single example very similar
    to examples seen before in class that tests not only their algebra
    but also their understanding of stochastic games.

    1.  Bookwork;

    2.  Bookwork;

    3.  Bookwork;

    4.  Exercise similar to one done in class.
